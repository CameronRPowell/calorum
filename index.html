        <p>The land of Calorum is like any other fantasy realm. There are kingdoms and rulers. Wars. Religion. Strife, death, adventure, love, and freedom. There are battles to be won, ancient ruins to uncover, and powerful beasts to slay. However, everything in this world is made of food. There are people made of caramel, bologna, pasta, milk, grapes, cabbage, and more. This is also true for the landscapes and the buildings as well. The sweet syrupy meadows of Fructera, the great stone candy mountains, the butter lake, the dunes of grain. To the people of Calorum, this is obvious and easy. To us readers on Earth, we might be confused how a gingerbread man can live in a cookie house when they’re both dough. All we need to know is that it works.</p>

        <h2 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="WaitSoWhatIsntFood"><a href="#WaitSoWhatIsntFood"></a>Wait, So What Isn’t Food?</h2>
        <p>While all things are made of food, the people of Calorum still need food to eat, make weapons, and build houses. So are the buildings made of people?! No.</p>
        <p>When the world was created, it drew on the light of the bulb to grow and the cravings of The Hungry One gave it shape and form. These first forms of life were a mix of plants, fish, birds, and other non sentient life. This was also when the first Food Spirits came into being, each one finding the place in the world that suited them. Food spirits of the hungry one sought to consume and destroy. Spirits of The Bulb sought to create. This balance kept the world in flux.</p>
        <p>But then, something new was born. In each region, mortal life came into being. Born with the creative power of The Bulb but also the Hungry One’s need to consume and destroy. Each mortal life struggles with this balance, never fully a part of either power but something new and unique. They took shape from the world, but their experiences and travel and appetites would change them, making each one unique and special.</p>
        <p>When a person is born in Calorum, their body will most likely have 4 stages of growth and maturation: infancy, childhood, adulthood, and old age. In infancy, their appearance is decided by their parentage. In childhood, the land they live in exerts an influence as they grow taller and approach puberty. When they enter adulthood, they find the form most comfortable to them that they will embody for most of their life. Lastly, in old age, their body will undergo one final change that carries the weight of their experience. This is a slow process and does not happen instantly. They may begin a meatball as a baby, a meatball slider as a child, a meatball sub with cheese as an adult, and may either retain that form or gain some toppings such as sesame seeds to show experience. This would reflect meatlander parentage at birth, a childhood in Ceresia, a life spent aboard a ship giving them the cheese, and lastly some sesame seeds and herbs in old age as they retire to look after grandchildren in Vegetania.</p>
        
        
        <h2 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="HistoryandTimeline"><a href="#HistoryandTimeline"></a>History and Timeline</h2>
        <p>The information contained herein has been assembled by the finest sages Calorum has to offer. However, little trade has transpired between the three continents so this information is focused on the largest continent of Calorum, which also shares the world’s name.</p>
        <p><strong>A very very very long time ago:</strong> The Hungry One and The Bulb came into existence. Two opposed forces of creation and destruction. In this ancient time, The Hungry One gathered material to eat and devour and the Bulb created more things. At some point, these two forces touched and the flavorless matter exploded into a colorful mass of color and taste. Calorum was born.</p>
        <p><strong>A very long time ago:</strong> The world grows and changes. The continents break apart and split into regions. Calorum, Mercado, and Yokadon. Each of these lands gives rise to intelligent life through the interplay of the energies of The Bulb and The Hungry One. These are the first Food Spirits and they carve out domains and realms for themselves in the settling regions.</p>
        <p><strong>A long time ago:</strong> Mortal life came into being. In regions strong in both The Bulb and The Hungry One, a new form of life appears. Of the world, but needing to eat it to survive and the spark to create. It is unknown how they came to be, but mortal intelligent life appears in each region of the major continents. They form religions around the food spirits, forge nations, and create civilizations. These early years are only speculated on by scholars. These people are each connected to the lands in which they are born and grow. They name the regions of the land of Calorum. Fructera, Vegetania, Ceresia, Candia, The Dairy Islands, and The Meatlands. Starting as loose city states, they grow in strength and power to become full nations.</p>
        <p><strong>About a thousand years ago, year 1 in the Bulbian Calendar:</strong> The bulbian church rises in power. While worship and veneration of the spirits, The Bulb, and The Hungry One were always around, The Bulbian Church rose to strength in this time. It begins a methodical and steady campaign to drive out the magical spirits and beings of the world. The Jolly Giant, The Hamburger Helper, The Sugar Plum Fairy, The Lady of Lacre, The Grape Ape, The Grain of Truth and more are demonized and either killed or pushed to the edges of civilization. Those that survive this must live in hiding, selecting their followers and agents carefully or risk exposing themselves. As the spirits are driven away, the natural magic of Calorum begins to fade. By the year 1188, the church’s influence had led to the pushback of the spirits in Vegetania, Fructera, and Ceresia. Candia and The Dairy Islands have managed to blend their traditions and appease the slow spread of the church by hiding it from outside viewers. The Meatlands remain largely absent from the influence of the church, but a few small churches have been established along the border, in places like Burgenstock and Tsardinia.</p>
        <p><strong>About 20 years ago in the year 1188:</strong> Tensions rose in the land of Calorum. War sparks along the Vegetanian and Fructeran border. A dispute over succession leads two nations to war. This war spreads to their allies. And the war spreads across the countryside like hot butter over bread. This event, known as The Ravening War, lasted years and led to the creation of an alliance called The Concord, where all nations agreed to unite under a single emperor and ensure that no single power could rise up against the other members, thus peace was established. All nations felt loss and devastation due to this war, and the scars have lasting impacts on events to come. While the Bulbian church had been spreading and gaining influence in the previous thousand years, its role in the founding of The Concord gave it vast political power. Its scriptures became akin to law in the nation of Calorum. Laws against spirit worship and magic sought to drive out the remains of ancient practices. There were also laws and standards put in place governing the kinds of marriage, inheritance, and legitimacy that could be recognized by the laws of The Concord. Some of these ideas went against long standing traditions, but changes were accepted to keep the peace. These changes in law would soon have drastic consequences.</p>
        <p><strong>Recent History 1214, The War of the Concord:</strong> After the death of the first Concordant Emperor, another dispute for succession leads to chaos and strife in Calorum. Candia wages a war against the rest of the kingdom, aided secretly by the Dairy Islands. While they were initially thought to be the instigators of the war, The Bulbian Church was eventually revealed to be behind the events in an attempt to gain control over the entire continent as part of some divine plan. Candia did not fall. The King of Candia ascended the throne in the year of our bulb, 1215, as the second Concordant Emperor.</p>
        <p><strong>1215, The Awakening</strong>: When the War of the Concord came to its conclusion, the world was suddenly struck by upheaval. Mountains shifted their place in the land, coastlines in the dairy sea cracked and drifted into new arrangements, great storms erupted across the dunes of grain, uncovering ancient ruins as all nations felt a shifting in the geography and magic of Calorum. A change had begun to spread over the land, an Awakening of what was lost and driven out. Magic was returning to Calorum. This chaos lasted for six years, shifting the balances of power and causing chaos across all the lands. Some of this chaos was political, such as the rise and fall of senators in Ceresia, and some were physical such as the floods and tidal waves that wracked the coasts. Eventually, these hazards would stop and the people would find the world changed. Stable, but new.</p>
        <p><strong>1222, Present Day:</strong> After seven years, this has begun to calm and settle. The Meatlands stand in uprising, needing a new leader. Ceresia is split into rival factions each gathering private armies. Vegetania is amidst a religious schism between the old and new tenets of The Bulb. Candia’s position is threatened on all sides by enemies that blame their queen for the recent devastation. Fructera is being threatened by rapidly growing vines and bushes, nature blooming and spreading as fast as it can be cut back. Lastly, the Dairy Islands have found new islands to explore and spread out to, leading to a flurry of exploration and curiosity. And amidst all of this, ancient powers have awoken from lost and secret places of Calorum, bringing old power for gold and ill purposes. What this means for Calorum and the rest of the world is still being written. And we are the scribes.</p>

        <p>Candia is a vast realm of sweet things and peppermint forests, vast plains of bright pink, fuchsia, and purple grasses, and rolling hills of chocolate chip cookie fields. The peaks of the Great Stone Candy Mountains rise high in the distance to the north, and swirling snowstorms of ice cream peak over the horizon. Tall trees grow in ancient lolly orchards, and sugar cube farmers and serfs toil in the fields. There are spiraling towers of sweet frosting and hard rock candy of fortresses and battlements of ancient empires. It smells sweet there, sweeter than Fructera, and is crisp and bright, magical and strange. At feasts, they drink classic, lemon and cherry flavored cola along with hot chocolate in striped candy drinking horns.</p>

        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Buzzybrook"><a href="#Buzzybrook"></a>Buzzybrook</h5>
        <p>A township located deep in the Great Stone Candy Mountains. It is the nearest settlement to Castle Jawbreaker. There is an open circle of sucrose standing stones in the middle of the village. Since the end of The War of the Concord, the standing stones have been restored to their former glory. This place is currently seeing a revival of the old ways and many new practitioners of the Sweetening Path have made the journey here to receive guidance.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="CastleCandy"><a href="#CastleCandy"></a>Castle Candy</h5>
        <p>The home of the Rocks Family, the longstanding royal family of Candia. This castle has guests from all around Calorum, especially from Lacramore and The Meatlands who support Queen Saccharina’s ideals in reforming the Concord and seeing magic return to the world. Castle Candy is located in a field in Candia. At the top of the highest tower sits a single swirled candy. Outside the castle walls are the beautiful rolling hills of the estate. The castle has several keeps. Surrounding the castle is a huge chasm of a moat that goes deep down into a cola river. The castle itself is simple compared to the intricate carvings of Vegetania or the grandeur of Pangranosi pavilions, but it is heavily built as a practical fortress of defense.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="CastleManylicks"><a href="#CastleManylicks"></a>Castle Manylicks</h5>
        <p>The home of Duke Joren Jawbreaker and his many partners, up to 36 at the moment. Spearia Mentha is a warm hearted and caring head of house and her husband Joren is strong and steadfast in his loyalty to his partners and to Candia. Yes, their marriage is open but they make a fierce and loving team. The Gobstompers led by Grash help patrol the mountains for wandering beasts from the Great Stone Candy Mountains. These patrols are especially important with the melting of the ice cream temple and the spreading of The Gloop. Spearia has also started a Druid Circle here dedicated to The Sweetening Path, and she is actively seeking new members to help bring back the old ways to Candia. This Circle even includes a few members from other nations seeking the path to reconnect to their own natural spirits and try to revive them. Castle Manylicks stands as a defensive barrier between Candia and the strange beasts awakening out of the mountains and it is a duty that the defenders take very seriously.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Dulcington"><a href="#Dulcington"></a>Dulcington</h5>
        <p>Across the rolling hills of the estate of Castle Candy and over a bridge lies the small, bustling town of Dulcington. The town contains a public house called the Mint Drake, as well as a tasteful lingerie shop that sells edible, tear-away underwear, by the name Lazi’s Fierce Lingerie. Dulcington is a township located just outside of Castle Candy. It is home to approximately 800 people. It lies on the banks of the Cola River and is accessible from the grounds of Castle Candy by two bridges, one of which carries travelers down the Sucrosi Road and out of Candia. This has also become home to one of the first schools of formal magical education in all of the six kingdoms. The Kinder-Arcanum assesses and instructs any willing practitioner from any of the six kingdoms. The buildings here are large and blocky with as many as three stories built increasingly large towards the top.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TheGreatStoneCandyMountains"><a href="#TheGreatStoneCandyMountains"></a>The Great Stone Candy Mountains</h5>
        <p>The Great Stone Candy Mountains are a mountain range that runs along the northern and eastern borders of Candia. These mountains are riddled with caves and caverns that provide protection and secrecy to bandits and illicit activities. But, they also serve as a defensive buffer, covering two of Candia’s 4 borders and running right along the walls of Castle Candy. Recently, it has become home to some dangerous threats such as The Gloop and a cabal of Dark Chocolate Mages that seek lost lore and secrets to turn into weapons. The Gloop, a spirit that was once contained by The Sugar Plum Fairy, is reaching out and spreading a thick syrupy substance through the mountains, trying to melt and consume the sugar peaks into its own body. So far, this threat has been contained but he has started reaching out to mad and power hungry individuals, offering power in return for their assistance.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Gumbia"><a href="#Gumbia"></a>Gumbia</h5>
        <p>Located in the northern reaches of Candia, the realms of Gumbia are bright and springy. The people here are hearty and strong. The lower valleys of this land are known as the Gumberly Plains and are rich with bubblegrains. The Gummi Juice distilled in the peaks is legendary for its invigorating properties. The Sour Squirts are a gang of thieves active in this area. Unpredictable at best and deadly at their worst, they take in war orphans, teach them a trade, or induct them into their bandit gangs. This gives them the appearance of honest work while working for their own gains.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Muffinfield"><a href="#Muffinfield"></a>Muffinfield</h5>
        <p>Muffinfield is located in eastern Candia. This small tract of land has rich farmlands and provides a great deal of sugargrains and sucrafruits for the greater nation of Candia. But, it is a simple place, with many large cake families competing for land and territory with each other. Deep grudges and long plans are the norm here. During the War of the Concord, Calroy Cruller allowed The Bulbian Church to march through Muffinfield in order to eliminate his former rivals with the iron and flame of the church. As such, it was untouched and has recovered swiftly after the war. However, now that he has fallen and Saccharina is on the throne, Muffinfield is being stewarded by Cornelius Cochran, a retired Ceresian Officer who helped guard Lady Swirlie during the War of the Concord.

It is unknown if Lady Blizza Swirlie will come to follow in his example or will be like her kind hearted parents, whom she lost in the early days of the War of the Concord.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="PortSyrup"><a href="#PortSyrup"></a>Port Syrup</h5>
        <p>Port Syrup was destroyed in the War of the Concord and is still being rebuilt after the chaos of war. The Chapel of Morris gives a place for people to gather and organize and pray. This has also become a thorn in the side of the ruling monarch as dissenters tend to gather here. The Sweet Tarts, a band of women leaders, have taken control of the city and are marshaling for change and peasant power. This movement is growing in strength as people see the results of two recent wars on the nations of Calorum. Their current goal is a check on monarchical power, a council of city leaders, to help maintain stability in the kingdom. Queen Saccharina is open to this idea, but negotiations between her and the leader of the Sweet Tarts, Twizzlina, often end badly due to two strong personalities clashing over what’s to be done about those that attacked Port Syrup. The destruction and loss serve as a reminder of what she and her pet dragon are capable of.</p>

        <p>Ceresia is the nation of grain located along the eastern edge of Calorum. It is currently a republic run by the Ceresian Senate, though was briefly an imperatorship ruled by Imperator Augustus Ciabatta. Ceresia has a vast array of landscapes, from the Crustin Mountains, the hot Dunes of Grain, to the damp Cereal Swamps, Ceresia is lush and plentiful. This is why it has such a large population. Ceresia makes up the lion’s share of the Imperial Army while also keeping an assortment of independent armies loyal to individual senators. The architecture of Ceresia is grand and palatial. Wide staircases, elegant grissini columns, tuile engravings, and high arched crust-domes. These are made by hand, the stones rolled or lifted into place by a specialized laborer known as the Panzanari, or more simply as The Brutes. The Panzanari begin life as a normal citizen, but undergo a secret training that transforms them by heaping immense qualities of dough flesh onto their bodies and shaping it into something new. The Panzanari stand ten feet tall with strange bodies made of different doughs and breads, pies, noodles, loaves, all fused into something new and powerful. During times of peace, these limbs have been used to craft, hew, and build. But during war times, the tales of their destruction are legendary. Marcus McDouble, a two headed burger brute, is the oldest and wisest of the Panzanari, and has become a leader in his own right.</p>

        <p>The noble bruschetta, a bready horse, is one of the most loyal and devoted mounts to be found anywhere in Calorum. And it is here, in the low foothills of Bruschettaly where those steeds roam wild and free. Many enterprising senators have made their fortunes capturing a rare or naturally strong breed of bruschetta, risking their lives in the dangerous terrain. Unlike most mounts, the bruschetta are built for rocky terrain and are able to ascend and descend terrain that would kill a Beefalo or a Meep if they were to attempt it. The bruschetta roam in packs up to two baker’s dozen to protect themselves from their one predator, Farrocs (fair-rocs), with a wingspan of 20 feet, capable of swooping down and carrying off a young or injured bruschetta as well as a foolish ceresian hunter.</p>
        
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="ButterLake"><a href="#ButterLake"></a>Butter Lake</h5>
        <p>This rich golden lake lies a half day west of Pangranos. The lake is rich with a deep yellow hue. Somewhere in the depths lurks the Hydrogenated Oil Beast and it is said only the Lady of the Lake can sooth his rampage. A small town exists on the edge of this lake, Flavortown. This is a town focused on trade. It has very low year round occupation and has a flurry of trade in the spring and summer, lasting until fall, but the lake freezes over in winter. The light triremes are able to glide out of the lake following the Clarified River into the Dairy Sea.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="CasaPanino"><a href="#CasaPanino"></a>Casa Panino</h5>
        <p>Casa Panino has been at the forefront for trade with The Meatlands ever since the fall of the Burgonion Kingdom. Ruled by Senator Bunn, this region protects the largest pass into The Meatlands through the Crustin Mountains. His estate is an immense U shaped building with thick cinnamon swirled columns and imported icing fountains to show off his wealth. This region boasts fine jewels from the ancient Kosher Mines and skilled artisans that weave clothing out of delicate angel hair threads. The trade of these has made the Senator quite rich, but he continually seeks more, and uses his Panzanari to help claim what he wants. And his power. Of late, the gems dug have started to show signs of discoloration, shades of pink and black, as if tainted by something deep within the earth. These gems have been shown to draw out some sort of magic power, as if connecting to the bulb or the hungry one, but how or why is not yet known. Except of course, to Senator Bunn, who hordes the deepest and darkest salt gems for himself.</p>

        <p>These dark woods are made of hearty Oat Trees that grow in a thick tangle of roots that spreads in all directions, weaving in between the other grain trees. It is believed that this place is alive and aware, like a sleeping giant. The ground often shakes and rumbles in this area, especially since The Awakening. In these woods live a few secretive tribes of independent Ceresians, the Chexons, the Visiohs, and the Alpendals. They are said to tame and train the beasts of the woods and to be gathering a strong force to try and claim some territory. The recovering Ceresia would make a fine prize for the tribes of the Grainwood, and if they joined with the Meatlanders, it would be a complete disaster.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TheGreatDunesofGrain"><a href="#TheGreatDunesofGrain"></a>The Great Dunes of Grain</h5>
        <p>South of the Golden Fields is a dry expanse of grainy desert. These mixed dunes of chaff and grain are hot and baked golden brown under a searing sun. Strange fibrous pyramids rise up from the dunes alongside rectangular whole wheat obelisks. These were built by the Ancient Granolans, but no one knows what happened to wipe them out. Since The Awakening has begun, dried chaff zombies and husks of fallen Granolans have begun to haunt these ruins, animated by unknown Calorian Spirits.</p>
        
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TheGoldenFields"><a href="#TheGoldenFields"></a>The Golden Fields</h5>
        <p>These fertile plains occupy the central region of Ceresia. The estates of many senators are dotted along these fields, especially near the large central trade road. These lands are peaceful and host wild herds of bruschetta horses, flocks of crackerjays, lumbering rhidoughs, and sharp clawed tigerbreads. Since The Awakening, cracks have opened in the ground here, releasing ancient grain creatures that can eat a person whole. Many regions once peaceful have been overgrown with thick stalks of buckwheat, massive trees that hide the lumbering forms of incredible beasts. Even those that avoid the beasts of the plains, the towering woods, and bandits along the Imperial March still have to worry about sinkholes that dot the land. These holes are dangerous because of the pockets of Mother Dough, hungry primordial slimes, that lurk under the surface.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Lapanta"><a href="#Lapanta"></a>Lapanta</h5>
        <p>This coastal city is a secluded northern fortess for the nation of Ceresia. It was founded by Cera Seme Sesamé, a wise Ceresian matron with ties to Vegetania who helped create lasting ties with Vegetanian spice merchants. She oversaw the creation of the Noahn Wall that encircles the city. Made from water resistant bagel bricks and held with cream mortar imported from the dairy sea, it is an impressive feat of engineering. Unfortunately, the wall was damaged during the Ravening War and remains a sad reminder of their past. However, no battles took place in this fortified city, so the cause of the destruction remains a mystery. While the port and fishing industries keep the city fed and offer some trading with nearby cities, that isn’t what it is most known for. Lapanta has a renowned college, Il Toccano, that has sealed and preserved documents from the founding of Ceresia and the first Imperator.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Millton"><a href="#Millton"></a>Millton</h5>
        <p>Millton is a town that formed around a great quarry of doughstone. Great masses of stone can be brought up, shaped, and carefully transported across the vast reaches of Ceresia. This is made possible because of the immense machinery that was erected here. Much of the work here is performed by Panzanari, capable of turning the great wheels and pulleys to bring stone out for common citizens to work on. This is also where the Panzanari are created. In a large building called The Proofing Chamber, chosen citizens undergo the painful process to become Panzanari and work for the good of the nation. This is considered a great honor and they are well compensated for their work due to the importance of their skills. This is a place of labor and toil and great noise, with the chipping of doughstone and the creaking of ropes and wood echoing towards the dunes of grain.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Pangranos"><a href="#Pangranos"></a>Pangranos</h5>
        <p>The capital city of Ceresia. This center of government is located on a narrow strip of land between Butter Lake and the Bay of Ardee near the Sea of Pasta. This makes Pangranos a center for information and trade between both coasts as well as the north and southern portions of Ceresia. The senators that rule Ceresia are found here. Any land-owning lord is entitled to send a representative to the senate and to vote on important affairs of the state. After the fall of Imperator Ciabatta during the War of the Concord, the new senate is scrambling to solve the numerous crises caused by The Awakening. To aid in this recovery, they have begun increasing the training and creation of the powerful Panzanari Guard, using these strong workers to pacify uprisings and rebuild damaged regions. The senators, seeing the increase of these specialized units, are starting to eye their fellow senators as competitors, wondering if one of them will be the next Ciabatta to rise, and so many of them are researching their own ways to create Panzanari, hidden weapons, or to unearth lost magics.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Taralli"><a href="#Taralli"></a>Taralli</h5>
        <p>Taralli was once a prosperous trading port for Ceresia, doing regular business with the Dairy Islands and The Meatlands. However, the effect of The Awakening struck this city like a rushing wave. The Dairy Sea rose up and flooded the streets, drawing most of the populace and sinking the structures into the waves. But, it was not entirely destroyed. The strongest and tallest buildings still stood above the waves. New buildings are being built on the ruins of the old. Many of these are erected by pirate crews from the Dairy Islands, seeking a shelter where they can trade without concern for laws. The senator that rules this area, Senator Jayne Crack, tried to request financial assistance in the rebuilding, but was denied. So she turned to pirates instead. Now this is a haven for all manner of larceny and skullduggery. Senator Crack passes most of the day to day running of the city to a pirate named Captain H.M. Crisp, who controls the markets and makes sure the city stays profitable for both him and his benefactor in the senate. This alliance is likely a temporary one, as the two despise each other and will almost certainly try to have the other killed in the near future.</p>

        <p>The Dairy Islands are a smaller nation made up of a collection of islands and are very naval-focused. These islands function like independent states, each with their own Lord Governor loyal to the crown of Lacramore. Many of its citizens are sailors, merchants, shipwrights, or fisherfolk. Many pirate crews also have some Dairy Folk among them because of their familiarity with the milk sea. Recently, with the demand for trade rising as places rebuild, The Dairy Islands have been very successful by building up their merchant fleets and helping things get where they’re needed. The sea has also attracted a rush of interest as new islands and tall spires have risen up from the depths. This has led many houses and explorers to seek out new lands and new fortunes in these mysterious islands.</p>

        <p>A bastion of the bulb in a remote corner of the dairy islands. The abbey was built on sacred Lacran holy ground. The altar was smashed and used to make the key stone for this bulbian fortress. The abbey serves many purposes in this cold corner. Town center, church, and orphanage. It also shelters missionaries that are on pilgrimage. At the conclusion of the War of the Concord, Basha Myaso banished the bulbian priests from The Meatlands. Those along the western reaches of that land had to flee quickly, and many of them gathered here. Now, the abbey is building up a militant force of bulbian adherents, ready to defend the faith in these times of change and chaos.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="CryingCove"><a href="#CryingCove"></a>Crying Cove</h5>
        <p>This cave, jagged and yawning like a mouth, slurps down the yogurt low tides. At low tide, it is scarcely visible except as a tiny whirlpool funneling the yogurt down into the earth. Some say that it’s the wind whistling through the rocks that produces that shrill sound of crying, but others who believe in the sprites of the dairy isles know better. This is the resting place of Gilead, where it waits, sleeps, and weeps as the tides flow over the entrance to his lair. On those fateful days when the spirit of Gilead is roused from torpor, the waters of the cove are sucked up into the air as the spirit sets off across the yogurt, spreading depression and lethargy where it roams. It is said that there are treasures that lie in the deeps, only found when the Cove is drained of yogurt, a gateway to other worlds, but none have returned to confirm these tales.</p>

        <p>The city of Lacramore is built on cliffs of study parmastone with buildings of aged cheddarbrick. The islands rise from the tangy depths, hardening bit by bit as the lacre crashes along the shore, pushing the parmesan higher and higher. Lacramore is built on the ruins of the ancient Lacra people, now ruled by the Dairy Islanders. Some of these stones still bear the curved sigils and tentacled marks of the ancient people. The Lacra people knew the secret to raising the stones from the dairy sea, an art now lost. After The Awakening, people have begun to seek out Lacra ruins and search for the lost magical arts they have left behind.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TheLeaningTowerofCheeza"><a href="#TheLeaningTowerofCheeza"></a>The Leaning Tower of Cheeza</h5>
        <p>When The Awakening spread across Calorum, the Leaning Tower rose from the depths of the Dairy Sea. A spiraling tower of a hundred rinds and wheels, ornate carvings of strange reptilian creatures, and countless odd shaped doorways gives an ominous air to this strange edifice. This tower has yet to be explored and the reason for this lurks along the shores. The Cheesasaur stalks the coastline, smashing ships upon the yellow stones and feasting on the sailors. It is said that the doors of the tower lead to lands beyond Calorum, if only you can find the right passages and face the challenges within.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="SeasonalStorms"><a href="#SeasonalStorms"></a>Seasonal Storms</h5>
        <p>These annual storms are born over the dairy sea, whirling faster and faster as they approach land. They are concentrated flurries of minerals from various lands: Chili peppers, salts, black pepper powder, garlic dust, thyme, and more. These storms are a blend of magical and natural forces of Calorum, carrying bits of materials to different lands and enriching the soils. Those caught out in the open during this may be desiccated by the winds and dust, continuing on in a sick unlife as they seek to drain moisture from the living. Some think this may be the true origin of the Jherky in The Meatlands. These storms are most common during the Bright months of summer. The initial storm and winds are known for their destructive power, but in careful amounts, the salts and seasonings left behind can be used in medicines, rituals, and arcane rites.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Threehold"><a href="#Threehold"></a>Threehold</h5>
        <p>Threehold has long been an independent city. Surrounded by a thick cheese stuffed crustwall with a large wedge shaped port. The walls of the city extend into the water, creating a wave resistant seawall, enabling them to control the flow of trade. This wall also protected them from the worst of the fallout from the tidal waves that rocked the coastline when The Awakening spread from Candia. This resulted in a boom of income as they were one of the few operating ports in the Dairy Sea during this time! Now, the city is growing inland and spreading out onto the waters. Great barges of mozzarella rafts and sausage skimmers are being lashed together with string cheese ropes to set casinos and entertainment halls out onto the waves. While most places are rebuilding, this city is thriving, resulting in an eclectic mix of people from all the different nations gathering here. Threehold is not part of any nation in The Concord. Their walls and navy have kept his place secure and in the command of the Council of Three, a secret council of three leaders that live and work within the city and make the long-term plans of the city. Those coming to Threehold had best bring a coin purse to trade with or be open to opportunity, as the businesses and entrepreneurs here seek new entertainments and new supplies to keep their prosperity on the rise or ways to undermine their competition and make sure only one family stays afloat, so to speak.</p>

This coastline is home to the Raisineers, a gang of mixed heritage pirates that stalk the Dairy Isles. They have two briegandines, the Breakwedge and the Gorgonzole. The thing they want more than anything, is magic. Captain Jacques Cheese believes he has the true claim to the throne of Lacramore because of his Lacran heritage and seeks to claim it by force if needed.</p>

The Sucrosi Road from Candia meets with the Glucian Road and continues down to the capital. The juices here are a point of pride and the beverages distilled here can pack quite the punch. This land is ruled by a parliament of several noble houses who elect a singular monarch to represent them on the world stage. The current Sovereign is Thaddeus Strongpit. This former baron rose in popularity after the truth of the Crusades and the War of the Concord were exposed. During the war, he never moved against Candia and instead worked to use his personal troops to move people into safety. After the war, he was a steadfast supporter of the new Concordant Emperor, and many in the noble council supported his election to Sovereign in a desperate attempt to regain power after the war.</p>

It has always been an important trade center, but saw grievous damage during the Ravening War due to its location. Now it has been rebuilt and refortified with a mix of aubergine and pumpkin timbers. This city is the Capital of the Grand Concord, a neutral ground for all nations. Owned by none and protected by all. Twenty percent of all fighting men from each nation are trained here to form the imperial guard that secures the safety of Calorum and prevents rebellion. The Great Pyramid of Food is the grand capital building standing a hundred feet tall with carvings of all the nations of Calorum. It is here where Emperor Rocks keeps watch over the affairs of the nations.</p>

        <p>Off the coast of fructerra, drifting slowly through the juice seas, are the great fructerran Jellybergs. These immense shapes are clearly handmade, molded and shaped into great pan shaped masses. Many seem to contain the remains of ancient Calorians, faces of meat, olive, and fruit suspended in the throes of some ancient battle. Efforts to investigate these strange ancient structures have met with difficulty as their soft structures have gradually consumed and absorbed those that linger too long on shore. Some people think this shows signs of some lost colony of meatlander/fructerran explorers but neither side has any record of such an expedition. This may be some resurfaced fragment of Calorum’s past, rising with the return of magic. Or judging by the strange manners of dress and unusual crossbows perhaps…from its future?</p>

        <p>This range is made of large sturdy melon boulders. The sandiastone and melonshale create bulbous towers that rise high into the sky. Winds from the dairy sea give these ranges a tangy air to them. These mountains are famed for the herds of Melon Goats that flit between the rocks. These goats are sturdy enough to serve as mounts and beasts of burden if they can be caught and tamed. Now that The Awakening has hit this place, many of the mountains have split open, exposing shimmering fruit gems and also releasing fruity spirits back into the world. Not all of these spirits are friendly.</p>

        <p>The Otterdrop Rapids are found in the highest reaches of the Melon Mountains. The fruit snow here is sweetened with spun sugar clouds from the Great Stone Candy Mountains.These snow capped fruit mountains shine with a radiance of rainbow hues of sweetened juice. These peaks result in flourishing rivers of colored juice, crashing over the stonefruits of the peaks and rushing down in an incredible display of color. These rivers are home to a variety of wildlife. These rapids are a source of high quality fresh juices for the whole of Fructera. Recently, there have been sightings of strange swimming creatures that are said to sing to passers by before pulling them into the deeps. They are white of fur with rainbow stripes, seen and vanished within a span of minutes.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="LasPaltas"><a href="#LasPaltas"></a>Las Paltas</h5>
        <p>This is the family home of Thaddeus Strongpit. Currently, it is a changing land, with a multitude of settlers and new citizens who relocated from Candia. It is not uncommon for people here to have mixed heritage between the two nations. This is because of the direct orders of Thaddeus Strongpit during The War of the Concord, to give shelter and aid for the people of Princess Jet of Candia. Strongpit was morose after he heard of her loss, and a large statue of blackcherrystone has been erected in her honor, as he would like to remember her. This place is also a growing center for the discovery of what has been called The Meadean Arts, a type of magic that uses sugar based alchemy to revitalize fructerran spirits. Thaddeus has taken an interest in the leading practitioner of these arts, one Hoeny Pye. Thad has attempted to learn some of these magics himself, but has thus far only learned to use simple cantrips such as mage hand and mending to help keep his clothes in working order. Whispers are spreading about beasts being called out of the deep pulpy earth awakened to serve some unknown purpose. Proof of this activity can be seen in the strange structure called The Fiend Pit, a deep chasm into Calorum that emits the scent of alcohol and prickly pears into the air. The beasts that emerge from this are thorned and hostile. They seem almost like Fructerans, but their shape and posture is misshapen and strange. While they seem to have a language, it is unknown to any who have heard it.</p>

        <p>This region along the eastern edge of Fructera is the ancestral land of the House Pomegrana. They were one of the first to ally themselves with Ceresia rather than openly war against them and incorporated their tactics and training into their own practices. Over time, the blending of cultures has resulted in a blending that has the military mindedness of Ceresian commonfolk and the pride and haughtiness of the Fructeran elite. This region, due to its ties to the royal family of Candia, was nearly burned to ashes during The War of the Concord, but the Lattice Lines managed to restore order and force most of the oncoming armies to divert their path outside this region. Now this place is seeking to rebuild and refortify, but they have precious little help to do so. Thus, the Allia Pomegrana is raising taxes on the common folk in order to try and balance his holdings. However, the strain of these taxes is starting to rile up the will of the common people, and a young cherry pie by the name of Homer Runns is trying to motivate a full revolt to replace what many see as a greedy ruling class.</p>

        <p>The fragrant shores of Pulp Bay are gentle and calm, offering safe harbor for the numerous merchant vessels. From Uvano to Comida, this calm bay fosters trade and communication between the two cities as well as beyond. All nations, save Candia, make regular trade through this bay to reach the two capitals of Fructera. This influx of trade has made the nation very wealthy and has filled the pockets of powerful lords. This bay is under the protection of the Limeys, a fleet of mercenary ships that patrol alongside those that hire their services to protect them abroad.</p>

        <p>These small islands are located off the coast of Comida near the Vegetanian border. Both nations lay claim to these islands but neither has been able to fully establish their dominance over the islands. The people of the islands consider themselves their own nation, loyal only to themselves. They are skilled alchemists and mages, which is how they have repelled all attempts at invasion thus far. They are respected for their skills and often explore the other lands in search of new ways to practice a type of hungering magic called Seasoning.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Uvano"><a href="#Uvano"></a>Uvano</h5>
        <p>Uvano is the capital of Fructera, named in honor of the previous sovereign and the founder of the Grand Concord, Gustavo Uvano. In a change of fashion, Sovereign Strongpit has not renamed the city and has instead focused on rebuilding and researching the change in the air. Fructera is being threatened and overgrown in many areas by sudden blooms of wild plant life which must be regularly battled. To aid in this, he has allowed research into the old traditions of Fructera to begin, aided with some refugees and new citizens from Candia. While not all Fructeran nobles live here, they all maintain estates here to make it easier to meet, discuss, and vote on proposals. While Fructera doesn’t have a king, there is an elected representative that governs the overall nation, balancing the needs of the many noble houses and presenting their interests in Comida. This is a closely packed city built of hard jackstone cement and cherrywood. Meetings between the ruling nobles are held at the Mendiant Council, a colorful building made from fruits and materials gathered from all corners of Fructera.</p>

        <p>The Meatlands is a stark, beautiful land of bones and red fields of meat. Meatlanders are a proud, noble people. Basha Myaso, the warlord of the beef clans, resides in the giant metropolis city of Carn. Recently, he has become stricken with a strange plague or curse that has rendered him too weak to stand or wield a sword. As a result, the tribes are on the brink of revolt and a Grand Meating is to be held to decide the strongest ruler. The sort of vibe they give off is that they don’t organize their armies as efficiently, but there’s an attitude of ‘one Meatlander can defeat a hundred Ceresian soldiers’. Wildlife within the Meat Lands includes massive, trunked and tusked mammoth monsters, which live in the far north. Its warriors wear bone armor with giant gladiator weapons. Some weapons are also made of bacon steel.</p>

        <p>This bordertown between Ceresia and The Meatlands is located high in the Crustin Mountains. This town is known for the slow flowing Gravy River and its hearty stock of poutine fries as well as the Nugget Mine which has rich veins of gold nuggets inside of them. This place was once the center of its own kingdom, from the mountains to the coast and the White Castle from which they ruled stands tall and dark. In recent years, ghosts and dark gulls have begun to stalk the townsfolk at night. The Baron of Burgenstock, an ancient evil, was driven out by Piletina Panko and her companions, but there are rumors of something new awakening and spreading blight across the land.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Carn"><a href="#Carn"></a>Carn</h5>
        <p>The Capital of The Meatlands. Located along the Sangre River, this metropolitan city is made of bone meal and heavy steaks of multitudes of meat. The city is split into two halves. The official government districts and housing are in the eastern half, called the Vkus. The eastern half, called The Rynok, holds entertainment, markets, and housing for the general populace. There is a large arena made of bone and gristle called The Tandoor which is used to hold formal challenges of might, which double as legal disputes, as well as contests of strength and prowess. Basha Myaso is the leader, but that is currently in name only. While on an expedition to The Tusha Ranges, a strange curse or illness befell him. He lies in bed ranting and fighting some unseen threats. His wife is the only one strong enough to hold him down when these strange visions take hold of him. In his stead, Scravoya has tried to lead, but more and more is being taken over by his advisors from the tribes. If he cannot rule, there will be a Meating held to elect a new leader in the traditional ways of strength, grace, and tact. Only the strongest can lead The Meatlands, and Basha is not that person any longer.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="CutterPoint"><a href="#CutterPoint"></a>Cutter Point</h5>
        <p>This peninsula is largely unsettled, and that’s the way the people of the Fish want it to be. The Fish Tribe has held this land for generations and they do not welcome the spread of cities and metropolises. The more inland and isolated people become, the more distant they become from the Fish and the way of the waves. Alba Coren leads this region, conducting the sacrifices and ceremonies to The Fish. They burn the bones and read the stars before setting out to explore the waves. The ships of the Fish Tribe are immense and elaborate structures, like floating fortresses. They use this to hunt great sea beasts and schools of fish that flitter in the seas. They are one of the few people that have journeyed to the far north with stories of strange insect-like creatures. Or to have visited the lands across the ocean, bringing back curved blades and incredible armors and bonesteel firearms from a distant land called Yokadon.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Gravillea"><a href="#Gravillea"></a>Gravillea</h5>
        <p>This region near Mt. Supsoak is volcanically active. There are pools of bubbling gravy that mixes with the terrain, forming dense pools of boiling brown bread, called bread bowls. There are trickling rivers of hot grease that leave shimmering slick panstones. And most dramatic are the Gravy Geysers. Dotten in the low-lying areas of the mountain ranges. These sleeping wonders are capable of shooting various gravies, white, golden, brown, up to fifty feet in the air. This region is dangerous and alien. The volcanic sauces have eroded the surfaces of the mountains and created dried encrustations of coagulated fat. Travel in here is best done with a skilled guide who can read the ground and know which areas are safe and which ones are active. With the recent awakening, the ground here is even more unpredictable. Great rifts are opening in the crusty peaks, releasing strange gelatinous slimes and oozes from the depths. The people who live in this area have deeply smoked skin, hardened, and cured to a perfect sheen by the extreme heat and salted waters that trickle through this region.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="HangarCoast"><a href="#HangarCoast"></a>Hangar Coast</h5>
        <p>This western coast of The Meatlands is covered with hills and vegetation. The warm currents to the west blend with the cool airs from the east and north, casting this land in regular bullion fog. The Cow Tribecall this place home and it is here where the largest Beefalo, the great Carnastadons, roam. There are a few roaming settlements in this region as the tribe travels to follow their herds and the changing of the seasons. It is this region where Basha Myaso was born and grew strong by hunting the Carnastadons, hiking the hills, and foraging for oyster berries. The Awakening has changed this landscape, pushing up ancient structures. There were always strange carvings of spamstone and ancient cairns. But now the dead are starting to claw themselves to the surface, ancient dry skinned sunken faced meatlanders from ages past. But these are not mindless raiders and shambling undead. They have the memories of their past lives and they seek to reclaim their lost lands. This is the threat that Basha Myaso was trying to address by seeking aid in the Tusha Ranges, but what he sought there is unknown. Now he lies ill and weak, and it is believed that one of the undead is feeding off his spirit.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Kuritsa"><a href="#Kuritsa"></a>Kuritsa</h5>
        <p>Far north of Carn, Kuritsa functions as a military fort and an isolated prison. It is the ancient home of the Tribe of the Hen, but it serves another purpose to the wider Meatlands. It is one of the most solidly constructed structures in Calorum, made up of stonebone and reinforced with baconsteel bars. It is used to imprison those that rebel against the rule of the Warlord. These captives are then used as indentured labor, allowed to work off their sentence breaking stones, digging channels, and constructing new erections in Carn like the Tandoor Coliseum. It is also the training ground for an elite squad of Meatlander military forces, the Hot Hounds. This refers both to the fire breathing hounds they ride into battle and the riders on their backs. Clad in heavy armor and wielding red charwhips, they are a thundering force of destruction on the battlefield. Their order was created hundreds of years ago to keep watch for some slumbering power in the Tusha Ranges. Now, the fort is lit each night as a watch is kept on the northern edge of Calorum.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="LoshadsRun"><a href="#LoshadsRun"></a>Loshad’s Run</h5>
        <p>This narrow mountain pass is named after Bo Loshad, a passed on leader of the Horse Tribe. For many generations, the tribe would use this pass to ride, or run, into Ceresia and raid nearby settlements for supplies to last through winter. However, under his leadership, he established a lasting partnership with Senator Bunn and wed his daughter to a daughter of House Bunn. Now they permit traders from House Bunn to use this passage and get a tax on incoming wagons, but they are only present here during the warm season. During the warm months, they stampede through the pass, melting the snowfall and chasing out any creatures that are lurking in the hills, using their numbers and ferocity to clear a path. The pass is still usable during the frosty winter months, but travelers are at risk of harsh weather and roaming beasts. Most feared of which is the Giant Slop Spider, an immense sloppy joe that lurks in the peaks, emerging with a brood of sliderlings to feast upon lost travelers. Traders know this is risky, but there are no safer overland paths in or out of The Meatlands, so they may consider the task one worth hiring mercenary assistance for.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="ThePancettaPlains"><a href="#ThePancettaPlains"></a>The Pancetta Plains</h5>
        <p>These open plains are home to the great meat beasts of the Meatlands. Towering herds of muscle and sinew that slowly graze on foiegrass and salami branches. There are also leaping spamalopes, sturdy beefalo, and curious babybacked boars that travel these plains. And hunting these beasts are the various tribes and clans of the Meatlands. While each tribe has their own general territory, hens to the west, boars to the east, and cows to the north, these lines are not set on any map and skirmishes over prime locations are frequent affairs. Since The Awakening, the power of The Great Beasts have started to return to the shamans and rangers of these lands. As a result, smaller tribes have begun to take a more prominent stance, like the Lamb, Fish, and Horse. However, this has also brought The Jherkey, smokey, undead vampires back as well, and the bulbian faith, now banished, is the best known defense against their power.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Swinehome"><a href="#Swinehome"></a>Swinehome</h5>
        <p>Swinehome is a wide and wooden region of the Meatlands, situated where the Pancetta Plains meet a dense wooded area called the Svyn’ya Forest. These woods are thick with thin Smokey Bacon Pines and the wider Black Forest Pine. These woods are a sacred place for the boar tribe, where they forage for Truffle Cones. These are said to be gifts from the tribe members who have passed on. These are then used in various traditional medicines and rituals. The great Black Footed Devil Pig also lives within these woods, tall and stately and hungry. As a coming of age ceremony, youths journey into the forest for 3 days, seeking a sign of the devil pig’s passing, and if they can find it and return to tell the story, they are welcomed as adults into the community. The Devil Pig is a feared and respected creature, a guardian and a threat at the same time. Thus, many rituals are performed throughout the seasons to appease it and gain its protection, rather than its ire. The lead shaman of the Boar, Maybelle Porcina, speaks of a time yet to come. When the Devil Pig will crash upon the Meatlands and charge upon a great city. But the time of this prophecy or the city, is still unknown. What is known is that the forest is growing, spreading outward more and more, spurred by some unknown force since The Awakening, and is bringing more opportunity and danger with it.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Tsardinia"><a href="#Tsardinia"></a>Tsardinia</h5>
        <p>This is a coastal fishing town. The egg people here are short, stocky, and do a profitable business pulling milkfish from the dairy sea and facilitating trade. Besides Carn, Sardinia is the only stable port in and out of The Meatlands. Recently, Tsardinia was raided by a crew of dairy pirates. As a result, they have started their own small fleet of pirate hunters, The Shellions. This firm anti-pirating stance has made a lot of enemies and thrown the previous nervous peace into a state of unrest as thieves and scoundrels clash with the city’s defenders.</p>

Chunks of beasts seem to rise from the ground, crusted and stiff in the salty ice. These mountains are where the great pack beasts of The Meatlands come to die and are swarmed over by scavengers shortly after passing. The Karage, a great fire-breathing bird and spirit of the hungry one, lives here and stalks prey in the dark caverns. Since The Awakening, the smell of hot oil and the glow of fire have been seen emanating from these peaks in the dead of night. Signs of some great and dangerous spirit.</p>

        <p><strong>Government:</strong> Collective</p>
        <p><strong>Ruler:</strong> The Heart of Sapprophus, sleeping but guiding through dreams and messages</p>

        </aside>

        <p>Sapprophia is the name given to the strange and hidden kingdom of mushrooms, rot, and fungus. Sapprophia is an ancient scattering of enclaves, a people united in secrecy and community. All lands have rot and decay. And that decay is natural… it is part of the cycle of life, the dance between The Bulb and The Hungry One. The Sapprophians, Calorians of mushroom and fungal forms, are born deep below the surface, formed of the detritus and death of those that lived above. They are connected to one another through a mystical network called The Mycelia. The Mycelia stretches beneath Calorum in strange ways, disappearing into dark tunnels and emerging leagues away, allowing the Sapprophians to travel with great speed and connecting their communities in times of need.</p> 
        <p>The ruler of this fragmented kingdom is a singular creature known as The Heart of Sapprophus. The heart is a motivating force, channeling the power of Calorum to give life to the people it protects. The Heart has no politician plans, no machinations, no desires… save for one. It has one purpose and that is to foster change in the world, to consume that which is rotted. In doing so, the magic and material of that substance or creature can return to The Bulb. It is the manifestation of the between The Bulb and The Hungry One that completes the cycle of death and creation for all Calorum. In more recent times, the last quarter a century, there has been a change in the Sapprophians. This stems from an injury suffered in the late days of The Ravening War that has forced The Heart of Sapprophus to retreat and nurture its own pains. Where once it had complete dominion and control over the Sapprophians like a body moving a hand, now it can only send dreams and emotions to be felt. They can still feel the pulse of life from The Heart of Sapprophus but.. their own minds are awakening, increasing in lucidity, personality, and ego.The Sapprophians have their own motivations now and are discovering their place in the world of Calorum.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="NotableLocations5"><a href="#NotableLocations5"></a>Notable Locations</h4>
        <p>Locations with ties to Sapprophia may reference other regions. This is because on the surface, Sapprophia touches on Calorum in a few isolated places and those are notable for that regard. Locations below ground are less well known as the Mushroom Queendom of Sapprophia is a secret for all but the most learned sages or those with first hand experience.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Finnsmouth"><a href="#Finnsmouth"></a>Finnsmouth</h5>
        <p>This small village in the Western Meatlands is primarily inhabited by the Clan of the Fish. They are strange people, mysterious even to other Meatlanders. They worship a spirit known as Hákarl, an ancient and slumbering shark that lives under the waves. The Sapprophians have begun to influence this belief, blending in traditions and practices connected to The Mushroom Queen to make it just as much about the fungus that infested its body as they are about the shark. This has spread into other areas of life as well as many cultural traditions of the Sapprophian people start to seep into daily life. Matriarchal power, decreased self importance, minor magical gifts, fermentation, and the start of fungal farming in dark basements and cellars. Skilled divers can plunge into the depths to reach an air filled cavern lit with blue-gray slimes. The caverns here contain ancient art and sculpture from the ages long past, and these tentacled designs of bulb-headed beings have started to influence art and styles in the region. Some recent babies have even begun to be born with spotted heads and almost vegetative appearances. These are, unsurprisingly, due to the growing influence of Sapprophia, and may be one of the revelations that alerts Calorum to the nation spreading underground.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="MelomelMeadows"><a href="#MelomelMeadows"></a>Melomel Meadows</h5>
        <p>This small town exists on the border between Candia and Fructera, outside the bounds of Sapprophia entirely. However, it is an important place for reconnaissance and information gathering. Sapprophian’s living here operate various meaderies and wineries in the area, substances in high demand. And the bottles from Melomel are most highly prized for their rich flavors. As a result of this, Sapprophians have been able to travel with their product to visit different nations, keeping themselves hidden under heavy robes and covered wagons as they make deliveries. Most famous among the Melomellian families is the family d’Noble, led by Lord Pourrir d’Noble, a wizened dried plum who has adjusted to life on the surface and loves his family while still sending information to Queen Amaritia. Queen Amaritia has lost a few citizens to repatriation in this way, but this has been a very profitable and informative outpost.</p>
        
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Porabello"><a href="#Porabello"></a>Porabello</h5>
        <p>Deep beneath the dairy sea lies the lost city of Porabello. This city has not felt the touch of The Bulb since the time of its downfall. Buildings here are made of dense mushroom bricks. Stocky and fitted against the walls, the structures are all interconnected, like the walls of a maze. The bricks each reinforce the ones near them, making the whole structure stronger. The largest and most impressive of these structures is the Palace Funglorious. Made of illuminated bricks, this palace spreads a low light across the entire cavern. It is from here that Queen Amaritia rules, attended to by her Toadies, advisors, and guards. Her advisors keep her informed of what they’ve learned of the surface as well as the events around Sapprophia. Tunnels being dug, beasts from the deep on the rise, intruders, etc. Her main rival to power is a great shelled turtle king, Drowser, that she keeps satiated with annual sacrifices. A subject is placed at the end of a long maze of traps, hazards, and foes. The victim’s champion, usually a family member or paramour, must race to the end of this labyrinth and secure the victim before the slumbering one, Drowser, awakens to claim his sacrifice. The purpose of this challenge is ritualized, as the slumbering beast feeds off the suffering and emotions the labyrinth creates. It also provides some moments of delight for the Queen, who has been known to reward promising heroes with favors.</p>
        
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="PortPencilli"><a href="#PortPencilli"></a>Port Pencilli</h5>
        <p>This is called a port, but that name belies the true purpose of the settlement here. This island hides an entrance into the Mycelia Mazes. House Bleu made contact with the Sapprophians while building a castle on the northside of their island. They discovered a deep passage and followed it, managing to establish trade relations with one of the communities below the surface. To this day, House Bleu carries a reminder of this alliance in the form of streaks of rot and mold on their skin. They supply the Sapprophians with intelligence and weapons in return for poisons, toxins, and magical secrets. The current head of the house, Danni Curdeau-Bleu, is angry at the death of her brother during the War of the Concord, and is working closely with Sapprophia as she embraces their culture and practices. To this end, she has moved here herself to help develop this connection and focus on close relations. To The Concord, she is simply retreating to shame and isolation.</p>

        <p>The network of caves and tunnels that Sapprophia uses to reach and contact the surface is called The Mycellia Mazes. They are strange branching interconnected channels. Some lead to dead ends, vast chasms, or strange horrors of rot and decay. The Sapprophians keep a careful eye on known passages into their realm, wanting to control the flow of information in and out of the deep dark. The Mazes can be reached in a few hidden places across Calorum. But many more surely exist, waiting to be found by Sapprophians and Calorians alike. The Sapprophians favor a series of hard iron pipes to transport them to places of importance and regular use within the Mycellia Mazes.</p>

        <p>Located in Central Ceresia, this yawning chasm periodically emits a cloud of yeasty dust into the air. This powder settled up for ten miles away, gradually coating buildings and structures. Ceresians in this region of dust citizens are advised to remain indoors and cover their faces with cloth if they absolutely must venture out. These eruptions occur up to twice a year and the powder has been useful in creating medicines and tinctures, but is toxic in its natural state. Explorers have attempted to venture into the chasm to explore the origin of this dust, but have not met with success. They have returned home empty handed or been lost forever in the Mycellia Mazeways.</p>

        <p>Vegetania is a bright and verdant land. The air is crisp and warm with a strong herbal aroma to it. This is the place where the Bulbian Church began and where it continues to hold power. This place is the least advanced with a religious and devout population. The nobles and clergy; however, lead rich political lives as they jockey for favor and position in both government and theological roles. Leadership in this land is split between the church and the state. The official head of state must be recognized by the church to have authority and the church must have the grace of the head of state to operate openly. While this in theory creates two balanced and equal powers, in truth most of the actual power is held by the church. The day-to-day running of provinces, villages, and lands is largely overseen by church officials with the wealthy lords acting more as figureheads. The Verduran Forest in the south is largely unexplored past the Turnip Tufts. The Taproot tribes closely protect their lands and drive back invaders with spear and beast. The taproot people of the southern wilds have grown angry at the rites and laws of the “leafy-greens”, leading to a growing fervor and a call to arms.</p>

        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TheBitterBorder"><a href="#TheBitterBorder"></a>The Bitter Border</h5>
        <p>The Bitter Border represents a contested strip of land between Fructera and Vegetania. The people of this land have the heritage of both nations and have traded hands back and forth over several wars before the founding of the Concord. Currently these lands are in the possession of Fructera as part of the settlement for the Ravening War. However, this place is always wracked with unrest and the upheaval and mysteries of The Awakening are stirring the already tense region. Currently Jewelia D’Aubergine is stirring up the common people and gathering an army to her side, seeking to make the Bitter Border into an independent kingdom called Giardiniera.</p>
        
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Brightgarden"><a href="#Brightgarden"></a>Brightgarden</h5>
        <p>Brightgarden is the city that is the center of the Bulbian religion. The Cathedral of St. Tubert regularly trains more clergy than any other religious building in all of Calorum. The city is technically its own political entity with its own police and laws separate from the Concord. Most of the buildings here are made from pure white starchstone. This city is devout in their beliefs and thinks the return of magic to the land is nothing short of a curse that must be fought at all turns. As a result, the clergy has become even more dogmatic and strict in their guidelines. Maizy Shuckmeir rose to the station of Pontifex after the previous ruler, Belisabeth Brassica, was imprisoned by Emperor Amethar Rocks. She is a firm believer in the might of the church and that in these difficult times since the end of the war, force and order is needed now more than ever. She has reached out to the commonfolk, educating and arming them so they grow up loyal to the church. Adherents trained here leave with a basic knowledge of self defense as well as techniques to root out and banish the enemies of The Bulb. While this city is renowned for the training of the clergy, there is something that lurks beneath the city. Beneath Brightgarden and spreading out is a long forgotten catacomb that leads to the caverns and deep dark beneath Calorum. There are rumors that there are heretical factions operating beneath the city, encouraging the spread of even more dangerous and deadly forms of worship.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TheGreenSea"><a href="#TheGreenSea"></a>The Green Sea</h5>
        <p>The Green Sea is a hot tropical sea along the southern coast of Vegetania. This region has fierce currents, sudden rains, and annual hurricanes. These are partly responsible for why Vegetania hasn’t managed to settle this far south. However, the jungles along this coast are not empty. Ancient hungry Vegans stalk these lands with sharp claws and flat crushing teeth. These Vegans are humanoid, standing ten feet tall but with a hunger for Vegetanian flesh. These Vegans are starting to look northward, stirred by the lights and sounds of the Taproot tribes; they may soon venture forth into civilized lands in search of meals.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Greenhold"><a href="#Greenhold"></a>Greenhold</h5>
        <p>The true capital of Vegetania is an ancient city surrounded by thick forests. This city is made of cruditimber and blends in with the surroundings. The Vegetanian city is the oldest capital in the six kingdoms because of the rich bounty from the surrounding forest. It was established by King Verne the Hunter whose bloodline continues to rule to this very day. The culture of this city, and by extension the nation at large, is slow to change, still keeping to increasingly complex rituals of rulership and manners. The War of the Concord did little to change these habits. The heavy wooden buildings are covered in carvings of vines and leaves, each one showing the glory of The Bulb by highlighting the bright life it provides. Many of these large structures are made with still living plants so that the building can grow as they age.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Pickerton"><a href="#Pickerton"></a>Pickerton</h5>
        <p>A small and isolated community, this village was originally founded as a distant outpost for Sapprophia. However, the people here learned to welcome The Bulb into their hearts, and turned to the light instead of to their Queen. Now, they are devout bulbians, using their knowledge of alchemy and fermentation to try and uncover new secrets to help rebuild the church and return it to its old power. Many of these people are a part of the Santis Putris and are working to find ways to create new and more powerful warriors. So far, they haven’t made new warriors, but they have managed to return some semblance of life to the dead and create slow shambling creatures of pepper and rot. This knowledge is still kept secret, as most people aren’t yet ready to see all of The Bulb’s brilliance.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TurnipTufts"><a href="#TurnipTufts"></a>Turnip Tufts</h5>
        <p>The Turnip Tufts mark the last civilized settlement in Vegetania. Any further south ventures into untamed wilds. Turnip Tufts is the collective name given to various serfdoms and farms that serve the different knights and lords of Vegetania. Tufing Meadows is the singular township in this region and supports a population of several thousand and many hundreds of herds of horseradishes while operating as a hub for trade between the civilized north and the rural south.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TheXylemeRiver"><a href="#TheXylemeRiver"></a>The Xylème River</h5>
        <p>This Xylème is the main body of potable liquid in Vegetania. It originates in the Gran Papas mountains and runs southward. It carves through the Verduran Forest, creating the Bitleaf Canyon before letting out into the sea in a broad alluvial plain. The Xylème is home to a variety of swimming beasts that can be gathered for food, but also carries a large pod of broccodiles that explore along these channels. The Xylème may carry one name, but is actually made up of many contributing rivers that flow from different peaks in the Papas Range. One source of strange activity along the Xylème are recently uncovered ruins found deep in the Verduran forest. The Taproot tribes have started using these as shelters and ritual centers but still more remain to be uncovered, like a large pyramidal structure that dominates a central tributary to the Xylème. The jungle grows lush here, but with sharp nettle thorns and poisonous rhubarbs that lash out at travelers. Whatever is growing in the heart of the Verduran Forest is not friendly to travelers.</p>
        
        
        <h2 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="LandsBeyondCalorum"><a href="#LandsBeyondCalorum"></a>Lands Beyond Calorum</h2>
        <p>Calorum is one of three major landmasses in the world of Calorum, and the namesake as decreed by the Bulbian Church. Mercado, and Yokadon are located many leagues away from Calorum. Mercado is in the Southern Hemisphere of the world, near the southern frozen pole. Yokadon is directly West of Calorum, almost opposite the globe.</p>
        <aside class="text--rules-sidebar">
        <p>Foreign Foods</p>
        <p>Calorum is heavily based on European and American food traditions. Greece, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, and a bit of Spanish influence seem to dominate the cultures and food personas of those lands. Mercado and Yokadon are intended to serve up different flavors. Mercado was inspired more strongly by Spanish, Latin American, African, and Middle Eastern Cultures. Yokadon is intended to be inspired by the cultures of East Asia, the Pacific Islands, and various indigenous peoples. How will these all blend together?</p>
        </aside>
        
        
        <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Yokadon"><a href="#Yokadon"></a>Yokadon</h3>
        <p>Yokadon is a large landmass cut through by powerful rivers of starch. The Riceron, The Noodleneck, and the Soylent. The arms and curves of these powerful rivers mark the traditional boundaries of the Kingdoms of Yokadon, with a central palace in the middle serving as the national capital and a neutral ground. These warring states are, in theory, ruled over by the Grand Rice Emperor, but his grasp over the varying nations of his empire has weakened. This has led to various rebellions and wars for land and territory between the 3 lands. Animarus, the land of the beasts. Blossonia, the land of fruiting flowers. Leavana, the land of leaves and legumes.</p>
        <p>Drifting near these main kingdoms, floating along the Nutmilk Seas, are two immense dragon turtles, each carrying one of the two wandering lands. The first of these drifting nations is Paneeria. Paneeria is most often seen in the colder waters off the coast of Animarus and Leavana. Its graceful structures of curd and whey offer a refuge for meditation and inner focus. On the other hand, the Sugar Palace is seen as a place of refuge and extravagance. Here, well appointed nobles rule over a strict caste system led by the Caramel Dragons. This land is most often seen near Blossonia, with whom it frequently trades in goods and weapons.</p>
        <p>Aside from rivers and islands, the continent itself is marked with strange geography. Long ago, the continent was hit by a terrible meteor storm. Chunks of concentrated spice bombarded the land, breaking mountains, diverting rivers, uplifting fields, and leaving new lakes and craters pockmarked across the land. For a time, the land was burning with spice, but as time passed, the people learned to use the spice. The spice-rocks became used in the creation of pepper powder, a potent explosive, and began making rockets, fireworks, and other works of magic and artifice. It was the discovery of this substance that led to the ongoing Spice Wars, as the largest kingdoms vie for control of the most potent sources of spice.</p>
        <p>Culturally, there are several important powers in Yokadon. There are political tensions between the three kingdoms as well as the Rice Emperor, each vying for control of the continent. Compounding this is the religious struggle between the Foodists, the Shisoists, and the Bulbian Missionaries.</p>
        <p>The Meat Lords of the Animarus hold a large swath of the western territory, but it is divided with harsh bone mountains, leading to several smaller lords each ruling their own provinces and swearing loyalty to whichever commander best suits their needs. The most powerful of the lords is Fugu Donburi, a coastal lord who rose to power when his city at the outlet of the Noodleneck became a prominent trading hub. This was helped by the raids he conducted along the Noodleneck, ensuring he held the safest harbor.</p>
        <p>Blossonia is an agrarian land, rich in fields and orchards. Spice is not as plentiful here, but they hardly need it. The farmers have protected these lands for generations, using their tools and homes and potent weapons. They have managed to strike a delicate harmony with their lands that has angered the Meat Lords and their desire for conquest and confused the Leavanans in their desire for unity. The Rambutama is a leader of this land, a spiritual leader and self made king of this land. Her family has deep roots in this land, so when they saw the signs of chaos and war brewing with the discovery of pepper powder, she was quick to cut herself off from the other lands and take a defensive position of isolation. While she is often considered a pacifist, she is not. She’s patient. And those who have tried to face her head on have met their ends in the fruited fields of Blossonia.</p>
        <p>Leavana is the last of the major kingdoms. This is a land of hills and forests, valleys, and canyons. This place feels remote, but it is vibrantly alive. This land has lush mangroves of leeks and vidalias, spinach swamps, and rolling hills of carrot pines. Leavana’s cities are usually perched either high off the ground in forested cover or at the top of defensible hills. Their roads are long, winding, and well maintained, allowing them to quickly cross their land to defend it. The people of Leavana believe in unity and order. They believe that the current Rice Emperor is a false heir and that the true heir is seated on the Verdant Throne. Emperor Ji-Kama rules over Leavana and seeks to unify this land under a single banner once more.</p>
        <p>The central region of this island is the Lands of the Rice Emperor, called Basmatine. While this region is the smallest of the mainland regions, it has the greatest access to waterways, meaning they have the ability to quickly move troops and maintain a sizable navy to patrol for danger. The Rice Emperor, Poi Pilaf, is a young emperor, thrust into the role of rulership after the untimely assassination of his father by an unknown hand. The central island of Basmatiri is a well defended fortress of loyal followers. He also controls many of the nearby coastal villages that thrive along the Starchene Lake. The emperor’s advisor, Khao is a cunning woman and a determined general, but even she knows that this war will not be won without sacrifice, if it can be won at all.</p>
        <p>Compounding the warring nations are the various religious and spiritual movements across the land. The Foodist Temple is of the mind that life is a trial meant to prepare and season life before the Great Maw, wherein all things become one. The Shisoist Monks however, dictate that life must be preserved and studied and reflected upon. That one must live in harmony with the spirits of the land and sea. These two beliefs share many common traits, well enough for the common people to accept them side by side, but the upper levels have come to blows on several occasions. A recent arrival is a new belief called Bulbianism. The Bulbian church has arrived with a few missionaries. They’ve yet to find a solid footing in the land, but in times of strife and chaos and confusion, their message of glory and peace under the bulb is a tempting message for many villages.</p>

        <p>Animarus stretches along the western coast of Yokadon. It is a rugged and mountainous land dotted with multiple volcanic peaks, steaming pools of broth, rivers of grease, and dense pockets of volatile spice rocks.</p>
        <p>The volcanoes are the first feature that catches the eye. Mt. Szechuan, Mt. Ramdon, and Mt. Karikari provides various resources of industry, insight, and recreation for the people of Animarus. They fill the land with heat and smoke, but provide the people with spice rocks, forges, and mineral rich soil to feed their population.</p>
        <p>The culture of Animarus is driven by a desire for power, conquest, and victory. With their vast resources of spice rocks, bonemetal, and proud warriors, they feel the weight of leadership and falls to them. Fugu Donburi rules from the far western coast in the walled city of Kametori safe from the frontlines of warfare. His son Fugu Taimura is a skilled commander and warrior, leading the front lines in his spiked armor. While Fugu Donburi focuses on the economic realities of maintaining a large kingdom, Fufu Taimura faces the daunting task of holding the border and leading raids on the nearby lords of Blossonia and Leavana. Eventually, these two motivations will come to head when peacetime comes and it’s time to award lands and rewards to the most contributing lords, captains, and officials, but both seek to avoid this conflict by continuing the war for supremacy, assured that if they can win enough land, there will be no shortage to award later.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Kametoricapitalcity"><a href="#Kametoricapitalcity"></a>Kametori</h5>
        <p>The capital city of the warlord Fugu Donburi, there is only one law here: the strongest shall win. Fugu maintains his dominance over those who could contest for his grip on the city by building a red herring in his port: the Sushi Dohyo (the space in which sumo wrestling occurs). A highly respected arena for those who wish to flaunt their prowess in battle, it is a no-holds barred death match for warriors to showcase their skills and be honorably welcomed to the Warlord’s personal battle guard. As a show of good faith, those who win consecutively in the matches get a personal 1-vs-1 round with Fufu Taimura with the prize being the title of General. Those who manage to survive one round get a month’s ration of rice for them and their family. Those who die, however, get burned in the Great Pyre on the outskirts of town, where their ashes can be used to fertilize the fields for the great Karaage mounts’ feed.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="MtSzechuan"><a href="#MtSzechuan"></a>Mt. Szechuan</h5>
        <p>Mt. Szechuan is named for the potent pepper stones that are embedded deep within its stones. This mountain is dangerous not just because of the steaming spicy broth that bubbles from the peak, but because of the noxious fumes that seep from the densest pockets of spice rocks. In small quantities, these fumes induce hallucinations and prophetic visions. If these continue too long, death follows next. Despite the risk, this mountain is still visited as a means of industry and prophecy. There are rumors of adventurers willingly climbing to their deaths when they enter the smoke-filled base of the volcano. In a desperate attempt to figure out the cause of this phenomena and stop the unnecessary losses of manpower, an adventuring party from Kametori was dispatched with specialized Lady Palm masks and was able to get a glimpse of the madness brought onto those who inhaled the noxious fumes. “They call for me… I must go… They call… I must heed…” No further knowledge has been recorded as the masks inevitably failed to filter out the smoke and only one member was able to escape the radius before succumbing to the poisonous gasses. The last member, found drinking her mind away at a bar, rambles about a beautiful voice she could almost hear through her one good ear, and how she should go back and listen to the song once more. But another shot of blood sake and the whispers in her mind quiets down once more.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="MtRamdon"><a href="#MtRamdon"></a>Mt. Ramdon</h5>
        <p>Another important peak is farther to the south, near the border with Leavana. Mt. Ramdom releases gentle rivers of broth that flow down into the Noodleneck. These broths also collect in various onsens and hot springs said to have medicinal properties. This is one reason the mountain itself is so popular even though it’s a contested region. These potent flows also provide a great deal of fertility to the lands of both Leavana and Animarus. This has resulted in an uneasy peace along this border, neither nation willing to commit to an open war that would endanger their own crops in this region. Instead, economic warfare is at play here, with two large cities Daikonoka of Leavana and Yakimono of Animaru expanding, advertising, and inventing newer and better creations to try and outshine their neighbors.</p>
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="MtKarikari"><a href="#MtKarikari"></a>Mt. Karikari</h5>
        <p>The last volcano that I will touch upon, there are several more, is Mount Karikari. This mountain is slowly simmering with heat and fire as flows of spice infused gravy seep out of the peak and any of several curry vents along its peak. This mountain is unstable and dangerous to tread on, but the heated curry lava makes an outstanding heat source for forges and industry. As such, the city of Curridon is the center of military might and power in the region.</p>

        <p>Blossonia is located in the cool northern reaches of Yokadon. Its northern coast is rimmed with icee glaciers and frosty peaks, descending down into a temperate region of rolling hills and blossoming forests. The smell of this land is bright and crisp in summer with rich notes of plum, cherry, and apple. In winter, the air is frozen and harsh with biting winds that cut you to the bone. The northern mountain range is called the Shaved Peaks because of the way the peaks of fruit ice build in rainbow colors like bald monk’s heads. The various forests of this region are not as dense as in Leavana, but they are vibrant and alive with spirits and animals and village life. This cycle of life and death and rebirth is what helped shape the guiding philosophy of The Rambutama, the senior guro of the Foodist Temple.</p>
        <p>Minasaki Hana is the current Rambutama of the Foodist temple, which believes all things that live must also die. From that death springs new life. She believes that the current wars are disrupting the proper flow, causing too much death and tipping the world into chaos. To some, this means that there is no point to go on living. But the Foodists know better. They know that life is meant to be lived, experienced, and to give flavor to the spirit. That when they are eventually consumed, they create a fine harmony with one another. When things are killed too soon, their spirits are bland and without flavor, creating unpleasantness to spread back into the world. To this end, she makes sure to keep a wary watch on her border, making peace when possible, but not yielding an inch to invaders. This involves many deals with the sweet fruit spirits of the land and asking them to redirect invaders, but it may also involve guerilla tactics to exhaust and cripple enemies before finishing them off under cover of darkness. It may have been possible to ally Blossonia and Leavana, but the path that Ji-Kama is on and the differences in religion have caused any attempts to quickly fall apart.</p>

        <p>Leavana is a nation of dense forests, misty rains, swamps, and strange beasts. Jo-Kama of the Choi-Bok family rules here. A warlord, a shogun, backed by the Tassean Council of elders. Tensions between Ji-Kama and the council are well known, but, in this time of war, direct force and power on the battlefield speak more strongly than wise words. Leavana has for many generations been a loose confederation of families, independent villages and cities with their own customs and rulers. Peace between the various families was handled by the Tassean Council for hundreds of years.</p>
        <p>With the outbreak of war, the people of Leavana had to defend their land or risk losing it to invasion. And this is how Ji-Kama rose to power, leading his small force of infantry warriors into battle against Animarau soldiers. Gradually, his small force grew, rallying to the banner until he had a strong enough force to unite the entire region under him. He created The Verdant Throne, which is theoretically located in the capital of Caulifornia. However, much more of his time is spent afield, charging into battle. He desires the throne above all else, but in public he plays the part of the noble hero. Toasting his men, praising the villagers, and hiding his true feelings behind a warm smile. One person that has not been fooled by him is the High Priestess of the Shisoist Temple.</p>
        <p>The second strongest force in Leavana is the Tassean Council, a group of elders that led the region during times of peace. It is composed of two elders from each of the seven cities of Leavana with one seat left for the head of the Shisoist Temple. The current head priestess is High Priestess Bambarella Lotus. While this priestess is new to her seat on the council, she is quite experienced in politics and spiritual affairs, having lived to the ripe age of a hundred and thirty thanks to her devotion to Lord Shiso. She shares some goals with the Verdant Emperor, the need for green lands and verdant forests, but she disagrees with the manner of leadership. She thinks his brash ways will eventually spell doom for Leavana if he isn’t stopped. She espouses the teachings of Lord Shiso and is respected by the council and the populace for her words of wisdom and her calm spirit. It is said that she can speak to all living creatures of Yokadon and even see into the future. High Priestess Lotus fires a stark white bamboo arrow burning at the tip from the temple to the base, and does a divine reading for the day from the scattered ashes of the arrow. Then, she tends to those who embarked on the cleansing pilgrimage to her temple and spreads the gospel to them from the Shisoian scrolls. Her personal guards maintain a strict boundary around her and the temple with their various tamed beasts keeping watch from afar. Her personal beast, a great scaled bird, returns to her each day at sunset, bringing news from afar for her ears only.</p>
        <p>The last prominent influence in Leavana is the priestess of the leaves, Teia Green. She is a reclusive druid who favors the wilds and mountains of Leavana. She keeps a pack of Inasu, great eggplant predators, and which she rides into battle with her loyal followers. She is not directly involved in politics of the region, but as one attuned to the spirits of nature and the wild, her voice is always heeded before momentous events. If she ever turned her attentions fully to war instead of the welfare of the woods, the impact of her power could shift the tides of war. A fact that those in power are acutely aware of, meaning that the enemies of Leavana are careful not to invite her anger.</p>

        <p>The land of Yokadon is crossed with many powerful rivers of starch. Some flow with buckwheat noodles, others with flecks of rice, pure soymilk, or other starchy foods, but they share a uniform white hue. The white rivers are not a single location or kingdom because they reach across the entire landmass, some don’t ever meet except in the great bay in the center of Yokadon. Across Blossonia, Leavana, Animarus, you will find coastal villages of noodle folk, rice farmers, and soy sailors. Each one is unique and reflective of the land in which they live. The three largest rivers are the Noodleneck, which divides Animarus and Leavana, The Soylent that flows between Animarus and Blossonia, and the Riceron. The Riceron is not like other rivers; it has no origin and no terminus, it rises from the earth and returns to it as it vanishes into caves and tunnels.</p>
        <p>While the White Rivers are not a nation to themselves, they have a strong tradition of fishing and sailing. They make up the majority of the Imperial forces because the waterways are so plentiful and they have a much needed skill in navigation. They know the rivers and their flows better than anyone after all.</p>
        <p>These rivers are the main place where one can meet the aquatic people of Yokadon, the Malaimen. The Malaimen have lithe limbs, with long fingers and hair that flows like the rivers they survive in. But in place of legs, are two long fins. Their skin and scales are predominantly pale, like the water around them, but they are also flecked with golds, reds, and blacks with hair of similar calico coloration. They are curious people that stick to their waters, periodically emerging to trade goods and stories with travelers. These encounters tend to be only on a small scale. They hold a deep grudge against cities and city dwellers for some ancient transgression. This also leads some of them to be more vengeful, and thus increase the superstition against their kind. Their kingdoms are found on the backs of the two great turtles, and it is from there that they lead, rule, and observe the actions of the land dwellers.</p>

        <p>The land of Paneeria is a land of incredible and impossible architecture. Buildings are carved of butterbrick and foncrete to craft strange arching shapes, unknowable geometries, and shifting patterns of flowing solids. This land is home to one of the foremost academies of the arcane arts. The shell of the turtle is soft shelled and tends to shift, tilt, and rise as the great beast drifts along the waves. This means that the buildings tend to relocate and alter themselves into strange new patterns in order to compensate for the turning of the ground. This is why many buildings are strange to outsiders, because the floor and ceiling may switch places in a given week, it’s important that cities be prepared for changes in orientation.</p>
        <p>Despite the shifting nature of the island nation, there are still a few landmarks to find. Miracle Peak is located at the head of the dragon turtle, a high and hard peak of solid golden curd that is used as a repository for the most dangerous of artifacts and knowledge that the scholars have discovered. This peak is protected by various traps, false passages, and secret doorways with the true and safe routes known only to the most senior of mages. That being said, many secrets have been lost when their entomber passed on, taking their knowledge with them. There is also the region called the Tangine. The Tangine is a region of connected pools of sticky molten cheese. Many cheese beasts have fallen into these pits, their bones still sticking up from the morass. Wheygulls scavenge these carcasses, growing fat on the masses of dead and fighting off rivals and travelers to protect their breeding grounds.</p>
        <p>This is the only nation to regularly meet with the Malaimen people, the milky seafolk of the Lactosent Seas and the various riverways of Yokadon.</p>

        <p>This is like the Gold Saucer; or, everything The Bulbian Church would hate—magical, whimsical, and utterly corrupted by greed. As nobles rise higher in power, their skin and features become more draconic. A part of a pact they make with the dragon turtle they live on. Each one becomes more sugary and as they get more sugary, they get their sticky hands into more niches. There is a large working class of various peoples here, mostly sugar people, that work to farm and serve and keep this place afloat. A great deal of money comes in from nobles of various nations and the export of spice powder weapons</p>

        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="HighFrostingsEveWinterHolidayChristmas"><a href="#HighFrostingsEveWinterHolidayChristmas"></a>High Frosting’s Eve (Winter Holiday / Christmas)</h4>
        <p>Held the night before Highfrost, this holiday is celebrated in different ways in different nations. Not all of them celebrate on the same day, depending on local traditions. But a few themes of charity, family, and unity are common in these celebrations.</p>
        
        
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Candia1"><a href="#Candia1"></a>Candia</h5>
        <p>Highfrosting’s Eve celebrates the lasting magic of Candia and its enduring strength. This is a time when hard work is recognized and efforts rewarded. But this time is not without its darker side. Make sure to start collecting sweetmeats for Mother Werthas and her cat Purrmungandr. If you don’t do your chores and be good through the year, Purrmungandr, her great cat will carry you off to feast on your sweet blood. Good Candians receive a change of clothes to welcome the new year with pockets stuffed full of gifts and trinkets.</p>
        <p>This is a very family-oriented time of the year, and small celebrations are held in private homes. During High Frosting’s Eve, lights are set out to show that magic continues to burn bright in Candia. An event called the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairies is a time where groups of performers wander the streets and open areas of Candian villages. They are pranksters and performers, usually from a circus, that play the part of different Sucrosi spirits avoiding the watchful eye of a clumsy bulbian priest. Of course, they tell the church that this is about how the church chased these spirits out... of course. These performers traditionally take up residence in a local house and it is said to be bad luck to turn them away. Luckily, they’re often sensible enough to find a house that has money to spare!</p>
        
        
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Ceresia1"><a href="#Ceresia1"></a>Ceresia</h5>
        <p>High Frosting’s Eve in Ceresia is a large communal affair. This is not only a chance for families to connect, but for the local governors and senators to show off their wealth and accomplishments. A great shrine or altar called a Bakingshearth is erected in village squares all throughout Ceresia. The local senator is expected to provide flame and warmth for all in their domain, so the more elaborate and magnificent the display, the more prosperous the village. This is when deals are struck and alliances forged as it is a time when people gather together across the distant reaches of Ceresia. Many weddings are held on this day. In the spirit of deals, this is a highly mercantile holiday with gifts being exchanged between families and individuals as a show of status. If you are given a gift, you are expected to give one in return, and it is a faux pas if you do not have one to give. Many people keep a stash of Animal Crackers, animal shaped containers that pop when broken. They contain noisemakers, riddles, jokes, and small paper hats. A single tradition is hard to pin down because each region is so different depending on what the controlling families in that area are fond of because of the compartmentalized nature of Ceresia.</p>
        
        
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="DairyIslands"><a href="#DairyIslands"></a>Dairy Islands</h5>
        <p>This time is marked by the burning of Yule Nog, a dense and milk wetted log that smolders and burns through the first week of Highfrost. High Frosting’s Eve is a day of anticipation and preparation, for the real holiday is the week to come. The first week of Highfrost is a time of feasts, drink, and memories. Cheesewax candles are lit on windowsills and lanterns hung on the rigging of ships each night for seven nights. While the lights burn, toasts are held and thanks are given and a general good time is had. The most raucous parties are held during the 4th day, and in some places the other days are only ceremonial with just a single party.</p>
        <p>Once the candles are lit, they usually last about 4 hours, relighting them is forbidden. Great care is taken to elevate them out of harm’s way. These candles may also be marked with the faces of saints of the Bulbian Church or other religious markings. After the candles burn out, it is taboo to speak or make noise. This is because the night is the time for the spirits to celebrate the ghost of the finished party. This is especially true on the final day. The celebrations on the last day are close and personal, a time for gifts to be exchanged between loved ones and for love to be declared. But when the candles burn down, it becomes a period of mourning and remembrance of those they have lost. Quietly, families carry small cheese ships to the shore, with prayers written upon the sails. These ships may contain tokens of lost loved ones that they would want with them in the next life. Long white matches are light and set on the deck before pushing the ships out to sea. As the ships burn, they carry their messages and gifts to the dead. Stories say that the milk sprites collect the prayers of the dairy youth and will watch over those who have lost someone close.</p>
        
        
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Sapprophia1"><a href="#Sapprophia1"></a>Sapprophia</h5>
        <p>The season of High Frosting is not marked in Sapprophia. However, those Sapprophians that are near the surface and out of the gaze of the queen, still feel a calling of home. Preserved sweets, meats, and other foods in the shape of people are made and eaten as ceremonial sacrifices to their queen. But the longer they are on the surface, the more like their neighbors they become.</p>
        
        
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Fructera1"><a href="#Fructera1"></a>Fructera</h5>
        <p>Lady Chiquita is said to bless children with gifts hidden inside fruits to celebrate High Frosting’s Eve. In the old stories, these were enchanted fruits filled with coins to reward the good and faithful Chiquitan believers who were escaping persecution. The untrue, wicked, and unfaithful would bite into hard pits that would break their teeth. Today, it is customary to exchange wax fruit at this time of the year to be broken open on Dark Winter’s Day. The bright colors represent the enduring spirit of Fructerans during the darkest times of the year when the trees and plants have frozen and wilted. Homes and business are decorated with colorful mosaics of intricate patterns in order to show family pride, military allegiances, or some personal meaning. These decorations are elaborate, sometimes including colored lanterns, making the cities look like illuminated jewels of fruit in the night.</p>
        
        
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Meatlands1"><a href="#Meatlands1"></a>Meatlands</h5>
        <p>In the Meatlands, Meatcat rewards the strong and loyal meatlanders when he flies across the lands on his flying grill. Meatlander children are told that their strengths, both of character and of merit, are rewarded during this season. He brings garlands of sausages left beside a fire, on a door knob, or on the pommel of your beefalo. The number of links are said to represent the number of great deeds you have accomplished or challenges you have overcome. In the morning, tribes and families gather near a fire to speak of the garlands. They take turns remarking on each other’s garlands and guessing what great deed the other people accomplished to warrant their links. It is customary to give a gift to those whose deeds helped you through the hard year, and this is a time to give thanks and appreciation to those you are indebted to. These are very similar to a battle of boasts, but in reverse, with people exclaiming the great and powerful deeds of the people around them instead of themselves.</p>
        
        
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Vegetania1"><a href="#Vegetania1"></a>Vegetania</h5>
        <p>The month of Highfrost is a solemn time for Vegetanians. Their kind doesn’t take well to frost, and their holiday reflects it. On High Frosting’s Eve, families decorate their homes with lights to celebrate the bulb. Covered with onion shaped glass balls or burning onion shaped candles, these lights can shine like day even in the dead of night. This is to show that even in darkness, The Bulb shines. Gifts are given to children who have performed all their chores and prepared the house to ward off the Hungry One. Adults will dress themselves in dark clothes and frightening costumes and stalk the night, tapping on windows and slinking away. Children who are full of mischief and sin are said to be delicious, and carried off into the night. And surely evil little children wouldn’t have such fine new clothes, clean rooms, and good toys.</p>
        <p>Starting on the first day of Highfrost, the season of Lentil begins. They give up one thing of worth and value to them, a vice or sin or indulgence. This is an act of penance that is done to correct their shortcomings during the year. Prayers are held weekly in the Bulbian Church to say the four prayers of The Bulb. Each week, people are encouraged to engage in an act of charity to others. For families, this act of charity is usually extra chores done by children, home repairs performed by neighbors, and gifts of food and drink by those with some to spare. The church keeps a steady supply of holiday treats, basil pasties, mint jellies, and carrot canes are traditional, which they give to children in return for a well recited prayer.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="HighbrightsHallowSpringHolidayEaster"><a href="#HighbrightsHallowSpringHolidayEaster"></a>Highbright’s Hallow (Spring Holiday / Easter)</h4>
        <p>This holy day marks the brightest day of the year. This day is usually used to mark weddings, business dealings, and lasting agreements. It is a day of good luck, high spirits, and festivities. Traveling circuses always make sure to find land near large cities on this day. This day also marks the start of forbearance for The Bulbian Church, and after this day of excitement, it is customary to swear off a vice until High Frosting’s Eve.</p>
        
        
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Candia2"><a href="#Candia2"></a>Candia</h5>
        <p>In Candia, the fields of sugargrass sparkle with glittery blooms of fine spun sugar. These delicate blossoms release clouds of colorful pollens that fall across the fields. To celebrate this, many communities gather this pollen and use it to create dyes to color their clothing in elaborate and stunning patterns. Rainbows and vibrant hues are worn to celebrate the changing of the season, with the bright colors representing the strength of sweetness persevering through hard times. A communal feast called a mix-in is held in a town hall or community center to come together, share recipes, and make small exchanges of goods. This is a blend of an outdoor dinner party and a bazaar, with people displaying crafts they made during the colder season and showing off elaborate costumes made to recognize the season. In the evening, Canadian children wear masks to resemble Sucrosi spirits before going door to door. When the door opens, the person asks “What is your wish?” Most commonly, they ask for treats, songs, a dance, or another little amusement. If the spirits are pleased, they give a colored chocolate egg to the person and leave with their own prize.</p>
        
        
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Ceresia2"><a href="#Ceresia2"></a>Ceresia</h5>
        <p>In Ceresia, Highbright’s Hallow is all about planting season and the sowing of seeds. Communities work by day and relax by night, exchanging loaves of love bread in the shape of hearts, butts, or other suggestive imagery. This is a way to help relieve the stress of the long planting season, but also as a fertility ritual to wish luck to new couples. This is also a time when people say prayers to the Ancient Grains, the seven guardian seeds of Ceresia, to ask for protection and good fortune. These prayers are written on thin tortilla scrolls and then buried near the home or near the graves of loved ones. But, this has largely become a Bulbian Holiday, especially in the South and in the Capital. On the day of Highbright’s Hallow, there are evening prayers held at the local church and citizens carry a canola oil lamp from the church and through the fields carefully, so the Bulb can bless the new crops and keep the land fertile.</p>
        
        
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="DairyIslands1"><a href="#DairyIslands1"></a>Dairy Islands</h5>
        <p>As a largely fishing and trade-based nation, the Dairy Islands do not have too many widespread celebrations of the season. However, this is a time where many fish are spawning so fishing vessels know the reliable places to catch a large haul of Milk Squids, Flying Jackfish, and the prized Leicester Swordfish. Those that remain home tend to perform small fertility rituals, as their partners are often more busy than usual with their shipboard duties, this is a good time to prepare a nursery. Highbright’s Hallow is mostly remembered by the church celebrations where morality plays are performed by children. The White Rabbit is a favorite story to tell, of a rabbit that protects her brood from all manner of dangers. Kids may wear masks, costumes, and participate in small plays to recreate these cautionary tales.</p>
        
        
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Sapprophia2"><a href="#Sapprophia2"></a>Sapprophia</h5>
        <p>Highbright’s Hallow is a difficult time for Sapprophians. They have a sensitivity to bright lights, and this day in mid spring is nearly intolerable. This is also the time when it is said they were driven below ground, forced to flee the searing heat of The Bulb, which dried them out, withered their forms, and nearly reduced them to ash. On this day, Sapprophian’s are traditionally mournful. Those that are on or near the surface, light no candles or lamps. Nor will they speak from sunrise to sunset. At the end of the day, the start of evening, they will cut themselves with a knife and let the droplets spill onto a plate. This plate represents the world of Calorum that they are destined to reclaim. As a side note, most only cut the tip of their finger and spill a few drops, but some fanatics may spill more of themselves to show devotion. They will then destroy the plate, say a prayer of thanks to their ancestors for getting them this far, and end the evening with a thick nutrient-dense Kombucha-like beverage.</p>
        
        
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Fructera2"><a href="#Fructera2"></a>Fructera</h5>
        <p>Highbright’s Hallow is a church day of prayer and renewal, the blooming of new life. During these spring months, the air is sweet and thick with fruit. In Fructera, this message of new life has taken on a decidedly romantic air. It is said that the air itself is full of romance. This has led to a varied mix of traditions, gifts, and displays of affection. Cards are commonly exchanged, passing compliments and well wishes to people. For the illiterate, these are usually simple square patches of banana peel, with needle prick pictures on their surface. Others prefer to give gifts of flowers, of which the gala rose is most prized. As the gifting of real flowers is a dramatic, expensive, display, most prefer to give smaller gifts. Romances are often declared loudly and publicly. Those with long term commitments tend to do something quieter and more intimate. Not everyone wants such displays in their face, but speaking against it is like stopping a flood with a tea cup. Those wishing to avoid such displays commonly wear a garment made of berries, as a warning that if you approach them blindly, you’re going to get pricked.</p>
        
        
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Meatlands"><a href="#Meatlands"></a>Meatlands</h5>
        <p>The Meatlands do not have a strong attachment to Highbright’s Hallow. However, they are not unwelcome to this new tradition. On this day, large casks of breadbeer and bloodwine are cracked open to celebrate the day. One thing that has started to grow are contests of strength and games of sport. Beefalo wrestling, Bruschetta Riding, Oil Wrestling, and many more contests are held in larger settlements. If there is a Bublian presence, which is rare now, there is barely lip service given. Far more often, champions praise their Great Beast’s power for giving them the strength to win!</p>
        
        
        <h5 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Vegetania2"><a href="#Vegetania2"></a>Vegetania</h5>
        <p>Highbright’s Hallow is a long period of celebrated time in Vegetania. The fields are green, harvests are rich, and spirits are high. This is a time when the church, traditionally, relaxes its moral strictness to let the populace celebrate their bounty and to show the good grace of The Bulb. Communal fairs are held, games are played, and decorations are hung, most proud and prominent being a great beanpole in a hundred colors of leavenwool, to celebrate the brightness of summer. In more recent years, The Bulbian Church has used this as a time to recruit new members into its clergy, monastic orders, and armed forces. Knights perform in fights of pageantry and honor. Stories are told of the ancient crusades that drove back the evil spirits. Priests and mummers take part in ribald plays of historical events. Meanwhile, in the southern forests, the summer rains rage fierce and strong, and the drums and songs of the Verduran Tribes ring strong and free from the Bulbian Church’s reach.</p>


        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Newseason"><a href="#Newseason"></a>Newseason</h4>
        <p>Held at the end of winter and the start of spring, Newseason is celebrated with fire. The Meatlands roast a great beast and hold ceremonial dances. Candia marks this with multicolored flames and alchemical fireworks to be set off at the setting sun. This is to mark the end of a finished year and wishes for the year to come are tied to rockets and sent bursting into the sky. Ceresia holds large parties, often very explicit in nature, with lots of wheatbeer consumed. Vegetania gives thanks to The Bulb with maypole dances, song, and small local festivals as a day of happiness for avoiding destruction at the maw of The Hungry One. The Dairy Islands hold their Aging ceremonies on this day, marking the transition from child to adult or adult to old age with honor and respect. That respect is usually shown by firing flaming arrows at boats laden with sacrifices and offerings to the spirits of the sea. The Meatlands greet the first sunrise of the new year with contests of might. Mighty songs, mighty brawls, mighty poems, and mighty meals!
        On this day, a Meatlander pledges themself to a new goal for the year, which they will devote their might towards achieving. If they succeeded on their goal, then today is the day they mark their victory with a ceremonial branding.</p>


        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Graceday"><a href="#Graceday"></a>Graceday</h4>
        <p>Held in High Harvest, this day marks the completion of the harvesting season and the first touches of snow along the ground. Offerings are made to thank The Bulb for the gifts it has bestowed. This is a day when people remember the lost and burn messages to their ancestors. They give tokens of affection to their loved ones. And they pray for anyone who was lost. This is a bittersweet holiday, mourning the fallen while being grateful for the good in life.</p>
        
        
        <h2 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="LanguagesofCalorum"><a href="#LanguagesofCalorum"></a>Languages of Calorum</h2>
        <p>There are a variety of languages spoken in Calorum. Ones marked with * were referenced directly in the actual play.</p>
        <p><strong>Carnish*:</strong> Spoken in the Meatlands, a deep guttural language. Likely sounds similar to Russian.</p>
        <p><strong>Ceresian*:</strong> Spoken in Ceresia, a front of mouth language with clear consonants. Likely similar to Italian or Latin.</p>
        <p><strong>Sapprophian:</strong> Spoken by the Kingdom of Sapprophia. This language is highly punctuated with stressed vowels and soft but clear consonants. This is most similar to Icelandic and other Nordic languages.</p>
        <p><strong>Fructerano*:</strong> The most “common” language. Spoken by most people in the land due to the high frequency of trade with Fructera. A highly flowing language with lots of vowel sounds and soft pronunciations and silent letters. This is likely similar to French.</p>
        <p><strong>High Bulbian*:</strong> A religious language spoken in ancient bulbian texts. This is reserved for officials and learned scholars of the Bulbian Faith. This is most similar to Hebrew.</p>
        <p><strong>Lacra*:</strong> The language native to the Dairy Isles. Front of tongue with vowels from the front of the mouth and consonants in the back, creating a timber like a rolling log. This is most similar to Gaelic in our world.</p>
        <p><strong>Spiritune:</strong>This language is unnatural and painful to speak, often resulting in nosebleeds and headaches. This is the language of spirits and magical beings. It sounds musical in nature and resonates from deep within the speaker. Similar to Mongolian throat singing with that deep reverberation. (This is a combination of the otherworldly languages like Primordial, Fiendish, and Celestial.)</p>
        <p><strong>Sucrosi:</strong> An ancient language of Candia, sadly forgotten by many. This is a focused and direct language with a focus on stressed consonants. This is most similar to English, especially American and British.</p>
        <p><strong>Vegetanian:</strong> Very vowel focused with rolling letters and rapid language with distinct front of mouth sounds and stressed vowels. Questions and exclamations rise at both the start and end. Most similar to Spanish.</p>
        
        
        <h2 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="SpiritsoftheWorld"><a href="#SpiritsoftheWorld"></a>Spirits of the World</h2>
        <p>Despite the best efforts of The Bulbian Church to wipe out magic from the land, spirits have managed to persist and old beliefs have remained to this day. While they have been diminished in power, there is a new age dawning. The Awakening has brought a resurgence of spirits and magic to all regions of the world at the same time that the War of the Concord weakened the political position of the Bulbian Church. Each of the spirits has their own motivations and goals for the world of Calorum. To achieve these, they often act through intermediaries such as arcane or divine spellcasters. While the spirit can bestow access to magic, they cannot force or compel a person to take a course of action. These goals are not restrained by alignment and it is up to the individual player or DM to determine how they work towards these goals. Unless of course some binding agreement was struck. These are some of the spirits and religions that are present in Calorum. Other lands outside Calorum will have their own spirits that can be discussed at a later date.</p>
        
        
        <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TheBulb"><a href="#TheBulb"></a>The Bulb</h3>
        <p>The Bulb is one of the two primal spirits of the world. The life-giving brightness without which nothing would exist. It is the cornerstone of the Bulbian Church, the largest religious organization in Calorum. To Bulbians, The Bulb represents all that is good in the world. It is life giving. It is love. It is justice and truth. It is mercy and peace. To live in the light of The Bulb means that you must pledge yourself to follow the doctrines of the Bulbian church. Foremost among these beliefs is “There is no power greater than The Bulb.” There are other beliefs as well, preaching the values of family, prudence, honesty, loyalty, faith, and innocence. It is a system of beliefs that preaches its own greatness over others. Other faiths and spirits have been demonized by the church, driven back and hunted into near secrecy. The recent Candian Curse (The Awakening) caused by the end of The War of the Concord has shaken the basic tenets of the church and the role of the Bulb and its control over magic. This has caused adherents to cling more fervently to their beliefs, like they did in olden times. However, the true nature of The Bulb remains a mystery to all but the highest levels of leadership. The stories of The Bulb and the rules of the church are known and upheld, but they do not know what The Bulb is. They do not know that The Bulb does not speak, or love, or value anyone or anything. They do not know that all The Bulb does is create and give life.</p>
        
        
        <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TheHungryOne"><a href="#TheHungryOne"></a>The Hungry One</h3>
        <p>The Hungry One is the other primal spirit of the world. While The Bulb creates, The Hungry One destroys. Things must be devoured, destroyed, consumed, lest rot and decay overrun the world. To most, The Hungry One is spoken of with the same fear and superstition reserved for the darkest of evils. A corrupting force that seeks to twist people into immorality. But, this isn’t the case. The Hungry One is just the force that seeks to destroy, and that destruction is a part of all living things on Calorum. All things that live must eat to sustain themselves. Due to the work of the Bulbian Church, worship of The Hungry One has become deeply taboo, even after The Awakening has caused the return of magic in many lands, this last mystery has only been investigated by a select few. There is a lot of power to be gained in destruction and the consumption of life. Dragons and other magical creatures grow stronger as they consume their prey. In time, perhaps a deeper philosophy can be shaped around this force of destruction, but as it stands, it is the purview of nihilists, the mad, and power hungry.</p>

        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TheGloop"><a href="#TheGloop"></a>The Gloop</h4>
        <p>The Gloop is a melted mass of sticky candy material. Toffee, chocolate, caramel, and nougat in a dense morass. The Gloop was held by the Sugar Plum Fairy for centuries. When she died and her castle thawed, The Gloop flowed into the Great Stone Candy Mountains and made a domain for himself called the Stickling Pass. However, some lingering wards prevent it from flowing past these steep walls. The Gloop increases in size and power as it eats. If it got free, it could threaten the whole of Candia, so surely no one would be insane enough to help The Gloop in exchange for a share of its power… Surely.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="JoyfulRancher"><a href="#JoyfulRancher"></a>Joyful Rancher</h4>
        <p>The Joyful Rancher is a being of hard sugar and bright colors. He usually takes on the appearance of a pleasant and smiling man with farming materials. He wants to encourage the spread of plants, agriculture, and vegetation. He is a new spirit, glimpsed only fleetingly by those setting into the expanded borders of Candia. However, in the past he was known by another name, the Warhead, who would bury his enemies with soured sugar and grow a forest over their graves.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TheAzureBeast"><a href="#TheAzureBeast"></a>The Azure Beast</h4>
        <p>The Azure Beast is a hulking figure of muscle and fur. Two large eyes rest atop a gaping black mouth, seeking prey. Its favored prey are Candian and Ceresian souls, especially the ones from Cookieshire who tell stories of the Cookshire Monster to this very day. The motives of this creature are unknown, but it has been known to grant power to those that seek a deeper understanding of good and evil. The Azure Beast slumbers much of the year, deep beneath the earth. The citizens of Cookieshire have a tradition to create a house of cookies at the edge of the town. In the morning, the shattered remains of the house are all that remain by morning. These fragments are said to be filled with a fragment of his power and are used to ward off evil and to make important tools and weapons.</p>

        <p>The Sweetening Path is not a single spirit. It is actually a collection of minor spirits of sweetness and nature that are spread through Candia. Believers of the Sweetening Path are usually descended from ancient Sucrosi bloodlines. The spirits of The Sweetening Path value harmony and balance and understanding, seeking to shelter as many as possible.</p>

        <p>The Ancient Grains are seven wise grains that have been around since before the founding of Ceresia. They are both their own separate selves and a greater whole all at the same time. They are called Kamut, Millet, Barlow, Oot, Sorgei, Chia, and Quinoa. Each one is said to embody a different type of thought. Hypothesis, Examination, Prediction, Doubt, Wonder, Steadfastness, and Passion. Each one considers themselves to be the most important of the Septumvirate. They are holders and seekers of knowledge, each and all in their own way. When gathered together, they are called The Grains of Truth and are said to know everything, even as they seek to gain more knowledge.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Bruschetta"><a href="#Bruschetta"></a>Bruschetta</h4>
        <p>Bruschetta is a bread horse of majesty and beauty. Said to be a wild creature of the southern plains. Long legged, broad chested, with a mane and tail of flowing golden pasta. He roams the southern plains and crosses the Great Grain Dunes with his herd. He is said to embody the majesty and beauty of the lands of Ceresia and to wound him would be to wound the land itself. While there are many breeds of breadhorse that are called Bruschetta, there is said to be one which all of them were created from.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Pumpernickle"><a href="#Pumpernickle"></a>Pumpernickle</h4>
        <p>Pumpernickle is the dark spirit of Ceresia. She walks on long gangly legs with a distended jaw. She is a dark brown beast in humanoid form. She whispers dark thoughts into the dreams of children to darken their souls and cause chaos in Ceresia. Spiteful and vicious and angry. She is spoken of in hushed whispers and warnings to children. In ancient times, some regions would offer a child during times of want and woe to ward off the misfortunes she brought and ensure a better harvest the next year. With the chaos and disruption of supply lines caused by the dissolution and reformation of the senate, some settlements may remember these old ways, much to her delight.</p>

        <p>The Cheesasaurus is a massive, aged, craggy beast. Longer than a galleon with a maw that can swallow a person whole. The Cheesasaurus sleeps for hundreds of years, sending dreams of terror and darkness. It is a beast of primordial power and fury, but it has also been known to rise up and strike against those who have wronged the Dairy Islands. Most recently, he arose off the coast of Fructera and destroyed the island of Pomme Pear and sank it beneath the yogurt shoals.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="ThePizzaRat"><a href="#ThePizzaRat"></a>The Pizza Rat</h4>
        <p>Pizza Rat is a Dairy Islands spirit with elements from Ceresia and Fructera and the Meatlands which all border the Dairy Sea. He usually appears as a small and jovial purveyor of games of chance or a crewmate with a friendly smile and a set of dice. He hides in dark spaces such as cargo holds, bars, and especially gambling dens where he can find people. His true form is a six foot rat with sparkling golden eyes and fur the color of pure white mozzarella. He is said to bring wealth and fortune but his rewards often require a sacrifice from the gambler. He will offer trinkets and small tokens to gain favor with his targets, but as one gets more connected to the Pizza Rat, the costs become greater. What he wants is time and devotion from those who play dice with fate.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="MaidClover"><a href="#MaidClover"></a>Maid Clover</h4>
        <p>Maid Clover is a spirit of the waves and winds of The Dairy Sea. Sailors are always careful to make offerings to the Maiden before setting sail. Shiny objects, things of beauty, written poetry. These are given in hopes that she is pleased with the offering and that, even if a dark mood strikes her and the skies grow dark with storms, she remembers the ship that gifted her tribute. She is a mermaid with a long black and white tail and an upper body that is a blend of human and cow features. When her mood is bright and cheerful, the waves are easy and playful and the winds are firm and flowing. When her mood is dark, the sky turns black to match as waves and wind begin to rip and tear at ships. She is said to listen to the songs and stories of the sea so families try to tell happy stories while their loved ones are away, so as not to invite disaster.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Gilead"><a href="#Gilead"></a>Gilead</h4>
        <p>Gilead is a spirit of sadness and despair native to the yogurt shoals. Most days Gilead is calm, peaceful, and lethargic. He is a slackened sail, a listless crew, a broken lute string. All sailors have felt the sadness of Gilead upon their decks. But on Milkday, this is Gilead’s day. On Milkday, he hungers for that which can never fully quench his hunger. He takes the form of a raging milkspout, sucking vast torrents of yogurt into the air. It is said that if Gilead can be appeased or made to feel joy even for the briefest of moments, an unfortunate disaster could be averted but, alas, this has yet to be seen. Only the salty tang of tears follows the wake of Gilead.</p>

        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TheGrapeApe"><a href="#TheGrapeApe"></a>The Grape Ape</h4>
        <p>The Grape Ape lives in the mountainous wilds of Fructera. Stories of him place him between ten and forty feet tall with long arms, broad shoulders, deep black eyes, and deep wine dark fur with light champagne colored skin. The Grape Ape is a myth, something glimpsed by fruit loggers and rangers gone far from home. These rangers seek the lair of the Grape Ape because it is said that The Grape Ape leaves rich fertile soil behind him. While he is a beast of mystery he is also seen as a blessing, so many farmers leave extra fruit or alcohol out on the edge of their property to encourage a visit from the Grape Ape.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Knightshade"><a href="#Knightshade"></a>Knightshade</h4>
        <p>Knightshade is an armored tomato in full plate armor. He is said to appear on battlefields defending the might of the Bitter Border. Not entirely Fructeran or Vegetania, stories of Knightshade always tell of how he helped a force of Giardinierans repel a destructive armor from either Fructerans or Vegetania. Darker stories talk of Knightshade in the woods at night, eliminating invaders in the darkness by inhabiting their shadow. Stories of Knightshade are punishable by death and as this law is becoming more and more enforced to try and pacify the area, the whispers of Knightshade only spread faster and the seed of righteous indignation burns ever brighter.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TheAmiciani"><a href="#TheAmiciani"></a>The Amiciani</h4>
        <p>The Amiciani are a collection of spirits from the days before The Bulb. It is said that the secret to their long life is strong drink, to preserve the skin and plump the flesh. They appear like average fructerrans, but on close inspection they have cloven hooves and pointed teeth. The Amiciani wander from town to town, collecting travelers, wayward husbands, disobedient children, and other vagrants. These people would be spirited away to a raucous party of merriment and mirth. In lighthearted stories, children are returned home after learning a lesson or a young hero wins a card game and returns home with riches for his family. In darker tales, children are never seen again and are squeezed and pulped into sweet drinks, husbands return home to a family that has long forgotten them, and young lovers are forever torn apart. The Bacchani love hearing all of these stories and delight in the retelling of them, the more dramatic the better. The truth of their motives are both and neither, as no two groups of Amiciani are the same. Now that The Awakening has brought back the old spirits, they are eager to draw new members into their cadre and new drinks to fill their bellies.</p>
        
        
        <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="MeatlandSpirits"><a href="#MeatlandSpirits"></a>Meatland Spirits</h3>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TheGreatBeasts"><a href="#TheGreatBeasts"></a>The Great Beasts</h4>
        <p>The Great Beasts are spirits of The Bulb. Parts of them exist in The Meatlands, the massive lumbering beasts, The Cow, Pig, Hen, Fish, and others. When a meatlander dies, their soul rejoins the Great Beasts and is returned to the Hungry One as a part of the greater whole from whence they came. All Meatlanders know which beast they are connected to, born from, and to which they will return. The beasts have no commands or tenets of their own, but the tribes of the Meatlands have inferred ideals based on the behavior of their sacred beast. These beasts are sacred to The Meatlands not just because they provide food and succor but because their essence is connected to the magic of Calorum and by partaking of their meat, a mortal can gain a portion of their power and become closer to the great beast on a spiritual level.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TheWhiteLord"><a href="#TheWhiteLord"></a>The White Lord</h4>
        <p>The White Lord is a spirit of grease, chili, and smoke. Astride a massive fire-breathing bird, the White Lord rode across the Meatlands for a hundred years before he was slain, but his spirit lives on. He whispers in nightmares and dreams to his enemies and those that seek his power. He appears as a tall meatlander in a suit of white armor with a rounded bucket shaped helm. He has been called upon in times of war, most often by the tribe of The Hen, to make skin into hard-fried armor or to call forth waves of burning grease to incinerate enemies. The White Lord has no form or body of its own, and exists as a lingering spirit that moves from host to host. The White Lord is always seeking to cause war and devastation with his blend of 11 secret tortures and torments.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TheHamburgerHelper"><a href="#TheHamburgerHelper"></a>The Hamburger Helper</h4>
        <p>The Hamburger Helper is a domestic spirit of hearth and home. Common rituals to this spirit are a simple thank you or request for help, “Hamburger Help Me!”. The Hamburger Helper appears as a single four fingered hand with a gaping toothed maw in the center of his palm. He is a helpful spirit, but his incantations must be performed correctly or else a terrible cost is paid. He is a spirit of The Hungering One, and while he is helpful, the incantations to summon him and call upon his power also serve to season the soul of the practitioner and make them more appealing to the Hungry One.</p>

        <p>The Jolly Giant was an ancient Vegetanian spirit of growth, rebirth, and health. Sadly, he was also one of the first ones targeted by The Bulbian Church as they solidified their hold. They used to appear as a thirty foot tall Vegetanian man, or woman, clad in leaves and vegetation. Their hedgerows and topiaries have become overgrown and wild, left to rot outside the immediate reach of The Bulb. As power returns to the world of calorum and the people grow unsatisfied under the yoke of the current leadership. Their resting place has been discovered by the Santus Putris and has become a vessel for rot and blight as they prepare to lead a reformation of the church. Their bloated weeping form is covered in mold and decay, exposing the bones and rotted heart beneath. No longer are they called The Jolly Giant. Now, they are simply called, The Blight.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="MamaYucca"><a href="#MamaYucca"></a>Mama Yucca</h4>
        <p>Mamma Yucca appears as an elderly Vegetanian woman, always with a body of a root vegetable with deep blue eyes. She lives inside a turnip that dances on three spindly legs. She collects poisons, potions, and elixirs of all kinds. Those who cross her may find their bloodlines cut short by sterility or deformations while those who help her could be rewarded with life saving medicines. She was demonized by the Bulb and chased into the southern wilds. Now good bulbians think she is arming the taproot savages with bombs and poultices to aid their rebellion.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Stinkroot"><a href="#Stinkroot"></a>Stinkroot</h4>
        <p>Stinkroot is a large striped beast of The Hungry One. Thickly muscled with burrowing claws and gnashing teeth. He looks like a skunk or a badger that stands six feet tall at the shoulder. Stinkroot smells like compost and decay, but if you smell its scent, it’s already too late. Stinkroot burrows under the ground, looking for those that are most fresh and pure in the light of The Bulb. Since The Awakening, he has dug channels and tunnels across vegetania with a rhyme and reason known only to him. Those who call on his power often require perfume so as not to let the stench follow them.</p>
        
        
        <!-- <h2 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="RulesforDarkRoastFantasy"><a href="#RulesforDarkRoastFantasy"></a>Rules for Dark Roast Fantasy</h2>
        <p>While the world of Calorum is whimsical, colorful, and magic is returning from several centuries of suppression. In most of the world, magic is treated with fear and superstition. This is because magic is tied to The Bulb, The Hungry One, or the unpredictable Caloric Spirits. I like to use the following modifications to the standard rules to keep tensions high without impacting player choice.</p>
        <p>Alter the way that death saving throws work.</p>
        <p>When a character accrues a failed death save, they retain those failures until they complete a short rest. At the end of a short rest, they may remove one of their failed death saving throws. At the end of a long rest, they remove two failed death saving throws.</p>
        <p>Spells that raise the dead such as resurrection do not exist unless the DM is making specific exceptions.</p>
        <p>Healing magic is more restricted.</p>
        <p>Only characters of the Druid or Cleric Spell List can learn spells that restore hit points.</p>
        <p>No bonus action healing spells.</p>
        <p>You may need to conceal your magic from certain people. Not all the nations of Calorum are accepting of magic and they still cling to the Bulbian faith.</p>
        <p>If you cast a spell using a spell slot, you may attempt a <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Deception" data-tooltip-href="">Deception</a> Roll VS the Passive Perception of passers-by. If they are actively watching you or surveying the area, this may be an opposed roll. If you succeed, the spell is cast without incident or suspicion. If you fail, they notice something was off about you, a hint of things being wrong. If you fail by 5 or more, they KNOW you cast magic.</p>
        <p>Most people know nothing of magic. Divine, Arcane, or whatever, it’s all the same to them. Many people of the Bulbian Faith believe that only divine miracles from the church are permissible. They consider all others heresy.</p>
        <p>In recent times, this is not the case universally, but if the game is set prior to the War of the Concord, you will want to make note that ALL nations held magic in high suspicion of heresy. The only exceptions being The Meatlands and Candia, who still needed to actively conceal any magic or practice counter to the Bulbian Church or face persecution.</p>
        <p>Magic items are meaningful.</p>
        <p>When you give out magic items, don’t just have them be a +1. Each magic weapon or armor should give access to some sort of special ability or spell. This makes them stand out more and make them feel more impactful.</p>
        <p>Weapons and armor are named. They have a Truename that is known by their owner. And a given name, which is known to the world. It is bad luck to say the true name of an item that isn’t yours.</p>
        <p>If a consumable magic item exists, it is likely alchemical rather than magical, but should still be treated as something of immense value.</p>
        <p>People are people.</p>
        <p>Do not use separate races like elves and dwarves. I suggest using Variant Human or regular human for PCs. A player may choose to be small sized.</p>
        <p>There is no racism based on appearance. People may distrust others due to where they come from, social class, or other factors. But never based on whether they look more humanoid or more foodlike.</p>
        <p>Or ignore all of these.</p>
        <p>It’s your game! You don’t need to use any of these suggestions to have fun!</p> -->

        <p>One thing that set A Crown of Candy apart from other settings was the focus on political intrigue and machinations behind the plot. It is likely that you will want to include some similar elements in your game. Here are some bits of advice to help you do that at your table.</p>
        
        
        <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Playersneedtobeinterested"><a href="#PlayersNeedToBeInterested"></a>Players Need To Be Interested</h3>
        <p>You can’t trick a group of players into following motives and plots. They need to know the tone and setting in order to make informed choices. Don’t use surprise “ah ha!” moments of betrayal that feel confusing if they weren’t following along. You need to let your players know that there will be secret motives and hidden agendas that they need to search for and they have to be interested in that investigation.</p>
        
        
        <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="MotivesandMeansshouldbeclear"><a href="#MotivesandMeansShouldBeclear"></a>Motives and Means Should Be clear</h3>
        <p>Your NPCs’ motives should be clear. It’s helpful to know what it is that they want and what they will do to get it. Using Crown of Candy as an example, we know that the church wants to purge heretics and control the population. We know Plumbeline wants to be the empress. We know that Keradin is solely focused on his duty. We know that Saccharina wants to rule. We know the powers they have at their disposal to get those things and we learn WHY they want those things. You don’t need to hide everything. The part you have to hide is how much the players can trust them.</p>

        <p>When setting up your political intrigue, remember that there isn’t just a single person working towards their goals. They have supporters and followers. This leads to a dynamic factions that support their leaders and can also be used to give information about the group’s goals. If you want to have drama over who will be the next king, present three options, each with their own pros and cons. Each of those options has a mastermind who leads the effort, a second in command that helps carry out their wishes, and however many minions you feel are needed. It helps to have a very obvious enemy, one that the players know is not on their side. Then a second faction that is on the fence and can be swayed. A third faction that is on the players’ side. And a fourth one that is a wild card to shake things up and cause chaos.</p>

        <p>Ah, <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Insight" data-tooltip-href="">Insight</a> checks… The bane of secrecy. When running this style of game, handling <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Insight" data-tooltip-href="">Insight</a> checks is more delicate than usual. When a player wants to roll <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Insight" data-tooltip-href="">Insight</a>, ask them “What are you trying to discern?” And you can shade your answer to reflect that. You don’t need to spill all the beans but if they rolled well, give them a truthful answer. If they rolled badly, give them an ominous answer. Here’s a hypothetical. The king’s assassin is trying to lead the players into a trap. He approaches the party unarmed to show he comes in peace. “The king needs your assistance. Please, come with me.” Then the player rolls <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Insight" data-tooltip-href="">Insight</a>. “Is he telling the truth?” Well, no, he clearly is not. But a response of “He is lying about something, but his demeanor is very urgent. And he seems nervous.” Gives character to the read. Maybe the players press further, maybe the urgency pushes them forward. If it comes to blows, cool, pop some minions on the board and now the players know they have an enemy. If they follow, run your planned ambush.</p>

        <p>Some people have been told not to play with their food. You were probably told that too. Only, you didn’t listen. You tinkered with different foods, materials, remains of illicit origin. This art was once practiced all across Calorum, by different names. Most of these ancient arts were long gone and forgotten, only recently uncovered in the notes of the late Primogen Alfredi. The Ceresian Cornstructors were the first to rediscover the art, but it is gradually spreading across Calorum as magic creeps out of the shadows, more and more people are embracing the lost arts of their past. This skill is based on the creation of alchemical golems, infused with a semblance of life and sent to battle. While the creation of larger war machines takes time and resources, you can easily make a minion out of scraps and trinkets, sending it off in your service. Your Corn Cuties, Sour Kids, Nuggets, Fruit Smacks, Curdlings, and Brussels Sproutlings are vicious and ready to go at a moment’s notice!</p>

        <p>You are quickly able to slap together a handful of trinkets and materials to create a small minion to do your bidding. These are generally violent and combat focused, but with careful focus can be used to help in more complex tasks.</p>
        <p>Starting at 3rd level, you may use a bonus action to create a small minion. This minion acts on your turn and may take one action in addition to its movement. They have the following statistics. Your proficiency bonus is used to modify many of their statistics.</p>

        <p>Your minions follow your lead, taking guidance from your actions.</p>
        <p>Starting at 5th level, when you take the <a class="tooltip-hover action-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">Attack</a> action, one of your active minions may also make a single attack. If you choose not to take your own attack, then up to two minions may take a single attack.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="LoyaltotheDeath"><a href="#LoyaltotheDeath"></a>Loyal to the Death</h4>
        <p>You minions are loyal to the very end, even if it kills them. It… almost always kills them.</p>
        <p>Starting at 9th level, if you take damage that would reduce you to 0 hit points, you may use your reaction to redirect that damage to one of your minions. Additionally, all minions summoned by you also gain +2 to AC and the damage die of their attack becomes a d8.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="ExplosiveCharges"><a href="#ExplosiveCharges"></a>Explosive Charges</h4>
        <p>When you send your minions into combat, they are charged with unstable magical energy that threatens to erupt upon death, sending mushed fillings in all directions.</p>
        <p>Anytime a minion of your is reduced to 0 hit points, you may use your reaction and expend a spell slot to have them explode with magical force. This deals 2d6 force damage per spell level to all creatures within 30 feet of your slain minion. Enemies may make a Dexterity saving throw against your Spell DC for half damage. You may exclude yourself and up to 5 allies from this effect.</p>
        
        
        <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="BarbarianPrimalPathPathoftheVegetan"><a href="#BarbarianPrimalPathPathoftheVegetan"></a>Barbarian Primal Path: Path of the Vegetan</h3>
        <p>Not all those who study The Bulb are clergy. One of the most ancient traditions is the path of the Vegetan, armed defenders of the faith. They bask in the glory of the Bulb in light armor or bare chests to take in the radiance. This can be channeled into their unarmed attacks to deliver crushing blows while drawing on the light of The Bulb to harry foes over any sort of terrain. They think that to embrace the bulb is to enhance yourself and that you must embody the might of it in all things. As they become closer and closer to their final forms, they become faster and their focus becomes increased, blending their rage to become a force of divine might.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="PerfectingtheSelf"><a href="#PerfectingtheSelf"></a>Perfecting the Self</h4>
        <p>Starting at level 3 when you select this path, you start to train your body through various exercises until your body is as dangerous as any weapon. Select one weapon with which you are proficient to become attuned to, even if it is non magical. Your unarmed attacks deal bludgeoning damage equal to the damage of the weapon plus the benefits of any magical effects they may possess. If it is a two handed weapon, then it only gains this benefit while both your hands are empty.</p>
        <p>Additionally, while you are raging, your unarmed strikes deal bonus radiant damage equal to your Constitution modifier.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="ThickSkin"><a href="#ThickSkin"></a>Thick Skin</h4>
        <p>As you continue your training, you learn how to draw on the light of the bulb to shrug off blows and punishment. Starting at level 6, when you use Reckless Attack while raging, you gain <a class="tooltip-hover rule-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">temporary hit points</a> equal to your Constitution Modifier. These hit points fade when you are no longer raging.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="LightspeedReactions"><a href="#LightspeedReactions"></a>Lightspeed Reactions</h4>
        <p>When you are hit in combat, you are able to use the power of the Bulb to quickly reposition yourself for a counter attack. Starting at 10th level, if you are struck by a ranged or melee attack, you may use your reaction to teleport up to your speed. Your final location must be within 5 feet of a hostile creature.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="FinalForm"><a href="#FinalForm"></a>Final Form</h4>
        <p>At the highest peaks of bulbian perfection, you are able to break starchstone and jicamasteel as if they were twigs. While you rage, your body glows golden with the light of the bulb. This is even capable of creating a crater in the ground with you at its center. Starting at level 14, while you are raging you ignore the Damage Threshold of objects as well as damage resistances possessed by creatures who you strike with a melee attack. You may also choose to use a bonus action to smash the ground beneath your feet, causing all ground within 20 feet of you to become <a class="tooltip-hover rule-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">difficult terrain</a> and dealing damage equal to d4+your strength mod to all enemies in the area.</p>
        
        
        <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="BarbarianPrimalPathPathofthePoet"><a href="#BarbarianPrimalPathPathofthePoet"></a>Barbarian Primal Path: Path of the Poet</h3>
        <p>The path of the poet is a tradition that began in The Meatlands. From there, the poet warriors of the meatlands traveled on ships to the other nations, spreading tales of where they went. The poetry of the Meatlands is not gentle prose like what is found in Fructera. Meatlander poetic traditions are fast-paced and incorporate the sounds of battle, iron, and boots. It carries challenges to enemies, boasts to allies, and cries of victory. Barbarian Poets tend to travel in search of new adventures and new stories, adding to their own personal poem, the story of their life. Creating their own heroic epic to be passed to future poets.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="BattleBallad"><a href="#BattleBallad"></a>Battle Ballad</h4>
        <p>In the midst of battle, you can follow up your attacks with a string of boasts and insults to spur your allies to action.</p>
        <p>Starting at 3rd level when you take this Primal Path, when you use Reckless Attack while raging, you may use your bonus action to grant a d6 inspiration die to an ally within 30 feet who can hear you. They may use this die to modify any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check during the next minute. This may be used a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all uses when you complete a long rest.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="StoriedExplorer"><a href="#StoriedExplorer"></a>Storied Explorer</h4>
        <p>Your travels across Calorum have given you a deeper insight into the cultures and traditions of the various nations.</p>
        <p>Starting at 6th level, you become proficient in two skills from the following list: <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Arcana" data-tooltip-href="">Arcana</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Deception" data-tooltip-href="">Deception</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#History" data-tooltip-href="">History</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Nature" data-tooltip-href="">Nature</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Performance" data-tooltip-href="">Performance</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Persuasion" data-tooltip-href="">Persuasion</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Insight" data-tooltip-href="">Insight</a>.

        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="DemoralizingEdge"><a href="#DemoralizingEdge"></a>Demoralizing Edge</h4>
        <p>While you cleave into your foes, you also leave deep emotional wounds that hinder their ability to strike back.</p>
        <p>Starting at 10th level, when you critically hit an enemy, they have disadvantage on the next attack roll they make before the end of their next turn.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="PowerfulBoasts"><a href="#PowerfulBoasts"></a>Powerful Boasts</h4>
        <p>Your challenges in battle, the ferocity of your strikes, and declarations of prowess hit harder than ever before, leading your allies to victory.</p>
        <p>Starting at 14th level, the inspiration die from battle ballad increases to a d8 and is also added to the damage your ally deals on a successful attack. Additionally, your own attacks hit with a deadly edge. If you roll damage for a melee attack and roll any 1s, you may re-roll them. This may be done once per turn.</p>
        
        
        <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="BardCollegeCollegeoftheBeastSinger"><a href="#BardCollegeCollegeoftheBeastSinger"></a>Bard College: College of the Beast Singer</h3>
        <p>In The Meatlands, there is nothing more sacred than the Great Beasts. The Cow, Pig, Hen, and there are many lesser beasts such as the Fish or Lamb. These spirits of the bulb are powerful and ancient wellsprings of life and creation. The Beastsingers are envoys of the Great Beasts, embodying their power in body and in song. While they keep their songs short and punchy, they draw out the hidden power within the recipients. Chants such as “I’m loving it,” “I want my baby back,” and “It’s what’s for dinner” are spoken in ancient Carnish and carry a great deal of power. As the Beast Singer grows in power, they become more dangerous in form and fury and impart that fury onto their allies.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="SkinoftheGreatBeast"><a href="#SkinoftheGreatBeast"></a>Skin of the Great Beast</h4>
        <p>When you become a Beastsinger, you take on the physical appearance of the beast you embody. This may be an animal head, a thick fur coat, tail and hooves, or some other obvious physical alteration. This offers no bonus or penalty to skills, but anyone from the Meatlands will recognize the power within you at a glance.</p>
        <p>At 3rd level, when you join this college, you gain the ability to use Wild Shape. This functions as the druid ability of the same name. To use Wild Shape, you must spend two of your Bardic Inspiration dice. The damage dealt by all of your beast form attacks is equal to your Bardic Inspiration die.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="SpeaktotheInnerBeast"><a href="#SpeaktotheInnerBeast"></a>Speak to the Inner Beast</h4>
        <p>Your songs draw out the spirit of the beast inside your allies, granting them confidence and protection.</p>
        <p>Starting at level 3, whenever an ally uses an inspiration die used by your Bardic Inspiration, they gain <a class="tooltip-hover rule-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">temporary hit points</a> equal to the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Wildsoul"><a href="#Wildsoul"></a>Wildsoul</h4>
        <p>As you charge into your animal form, your claws and teeth become charged with the power of the Great Beasts.</p>
        <p>Starting at 6th level, your attacks in beast form count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non magical attacks and damage. If you are attuned to a magical weapon, your attacks in beast form gain the same bonuses and benefits as the attuned item.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Beastly"><a href="#Beastly"></a>Beastly</h4>
        <p>As your connection to the Great Beasts grows, you learn to impart more of their essence into your allies.</p>
        <p>Starting at level 14, as an action, you may transform yourself and up to five additional willing creatures to assume an animal form, as if using the Wild Shape ability. If your allies do not normally have access to Wild Shape, they may assume any form that would be usable by a druid of 8th level. Once this ability is used, it may not be used again until you complete a Long or short rest.</p>
        
        
        <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="ClericDomainFungus"><a href="#ClericDomainFungus"></a>Cleric Domain: Fungus</h3>
        <p>You have uncovered a secret truth to the world of Calorum, one that was buried beneath the surface, slowly spreading across the land. In caves and caverns beneath Calorum there is a network of fungus, mushrooms, and rot. This land is fractured and split, with isolated conclaves and fiefdoms under each kingdom. United and separate. They foster certain types of rot and decay, but not just death. It creates new life. This kingdom is still hidden from most of Calorum, but you have felt the pull of power, the mighty Princess Puffball. The goals of the Mushroom Queendom is to build, spread, and grow. Whether that means peace or war has yet to be determined, but the unrest caused by the Awakening has given an opportunity for you to spread the might of the fungal kingdoms.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="RotandRenewal"><a href="#RotandRenewal"></a>Rot and Renewal</h4>
        <p>As life passes around you, you can draw on a portion of that power to rejuvenate yourself.</p>
        <p>Starting at 1st level, when you select this domain you learn to draw power from death. If an enemy is reduced to 0 hit points within 15 feet of you, you may grant <a class="tooltip-hover rule-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">temporary hit points</a> equal to your Wisdom modifier to yourself or an ally within 15 feet of you.</p>

        <p>Starting at 1st level, you cast <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">enlarge/reduce</a> as a bonus action. This is not a concentration effect. Only 1 creature may benefit from this ability at a time. You may use this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all uses when you complete a long rest.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="ChannelDivinityFungalSpread"><a href="#ChannelDivinityFungalSpread"></a>Channel Divinity: Fungal Spread</h4>
        <p>At 2nd level, you gain the following Channel Divinity option.</p>
        <p>As an action, you present your holy symbol and call out to the power of the Mushroom Queendom. This causes an area of mushrooms and mold to grow outward from a point you select within 30 feet of you. This starts as a ten foot radius and grows outward an additional 10 feet at the start of each of your turns out to a maximum of 60 feet. All enemies that start their turn in the area must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. If they fail, they take poison damage equal to 1d6 + your Wisdom modifier. If they succeed, then an ally in the area regains 1d6 + your Wisdom modifier hit points. This area remains in the place where you cast it. It lasts for 1 minute.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="NaturallyResistant"><a href="#NaturallyResistant"></a>Naturally Resistant</h4>
        <p>Your time spent around toxins have made you resistant to poisons and given you an understanding about how they work.</p>
        <p>Starting at 6th level, you gain resistance to poison damage and become immune to the poisoned condition.

        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="PreservetheFallen"><a href="#PreservetheFallen"></a>Preserve the Fallen</h4>
        <p>Starting at 17th level, your power keeps your allies standing even in the darkest times.</p>
        <p>When an ally within 30 feet of you is reduced to 0 hit points, you may spend your reaction to use Preserve the Fallen on that ally. An ally under the effect of Preserve the Fallen may fight as normal. They continue to have the Dying condition as long as they are at 0 hit points, and must make death saving throws at the start of their turn as normal. Only one ally may benefit from this ability at a time. If you attempt to use this on a second ally, this effect immediately ends on the first ally. If an ally has the dying condition when this effect ends, they immediately suffer a failed death saving throw.</p>
        
        
        <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="ClericDomainSoul"><a href="#ClericDomainSoul"></a>Cleric Domain: Soul</h3>
        <p>In every being of Calorum, there is a soul or spirit. When a creature passes from life into death, they become beings of pure spirit before returning to their resting place. The Domain of Soul focuses on the spirit that is contained within all the lands of Calorum. They use their miracles to strengthen their own spirit, gathering a portion of it around themselves and using it to shield themselves from harm. They can revitalize the spirit and invigorate them or they can suck a portion of life force from their enemies to strengthen themselves. The domain of Soul is most often practiced by the spice breathers of the Hen Tribe, the sesame seers of Ceresia, and even by Bulbian miracle workers.</p>

        <p>You may choose to make your Armor Class 16. You may not use this benefit while you are wearing armor of any kind. You may still use a shield. Activating or deactivating this is a free action. While you are using this ability, your attacks with melee and ranged weapons bypass any resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="ChannelDivinitySoulFood"><a href="#ChannelDivinitySoulFood"></a>Channel Divinity: Soul Food</h4>
        <p>At 2nd level, you gain the following Channel Divinity option.</p>
        <p>All enemies within 30 feet of you must make a Charisma Saving Throw against your Spell DC. If they fail, they take psychic damage equal to 2d6 + your Wisdom modifier. A successful saving throw reduces this by half. You gain a pool of hit points equal to half the total damage done. You may use this pool to heal yourself or any ally within 30 feet. You and each ally in the area then gain an additional 1d6 hit points.</p>
        <p>At levels 8, 12, 16, and 20, the damage increases by 2d6 and the healing increases by 1d6.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TouchtheSpirit"><a href="#TouchtheSpirit"></a>Touch the Spirit</h4>
        <p>When you lay your hand on another creature, the magic you channel is more effective than normal as you connect to their soul. This also enables you to pass on some sureness of spirit to those near to you.</p>
        <p>Starting at level 6, If you cast a spell with a range of touch, you increase the damage done or healing received by your wisdom modifier.</p>
        <p>Additionally, if an ally within 15 feet of you makes an ability check using Wisdom or Charisma, you may use your reaction to add your Wisdom modifier to the result. You may use this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all uses when you complete a long rest.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="ImprovedArmoroftheSoul"><a href="#ImprovedArmoroftheSoul"></a>Improved Armor of the Soul</h4>
        <p>As you have grown in power, so has your soul as it that protects you.</p>
        <p>Starting at 8th level, once per round you may use your bonus action to make a single melee attack with a weapon you are wielding. Additionally, the AC bonus from Armor of the Soul increases to 18.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="UnbrokenSpirit"><a href="#UnbrokenSpirit"></a>Unbroken Spirit</h4>
        <p>Your soul manifests around you as a great champion and defender of what you stand for.</p>
        <p>When you deal a critical hit, you gain <a class="tooltip-hover rule-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">temporary hit points</a> equal to 2d8 + your proficiency bonus. Additionally, when an enemy rolls a critical hit against you, you may choose to gain <a class="tooltip-hover rule-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">temporary hit points</a> equal to 2d8 + your proficiency bonus, or you may choose to deal radiant damage equal to 2d8 + your proficiency bonus to the triggering enemy. All of these are chosen after the roll is made, but before damage is rolled, offering you a chance to reduce incoming damage or negating it.</p>
        
        
        <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="DruidCircleCircleoftheHungry"><a href="#DruidCircleCircleoftheHungry"></a>Druid Circle: Circle of the Hungry</h3>
        <p>The Circle of the Hungry is both new and ancient simultaneously. In ancient times, there were spirits of the Hungry One active in Calorum. Pumpernickel, The Gloop, The White Colonel, and other forces of destruction. While they were feared by the people of the world, they were just as much a part of the cycle of life and death as the Jolly Giant, Sugar Plum Fairy, and Great Beasts.</p>
        <p>There can be no life without destruction. The Circle of the Hungry has embraced this path of destruction and power. They ensured that herds don’t strip the land, that towns don’t push too deep into the landscape, and that the darker spirits receive the respect and reverence due to them. While some view the Circle of the Hungry as mad or apocalyptic, they are only maintaining the balance of the world in their own way.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="HungeringAnimal"><a href="#HungeringAnimal"></a>Hungering Animal</h4>
        <p>You have tapped into the nature of the Hungering Spirits of the world and embraced that part within yourself that hungers.</p>
        <p>Starting at 2nd level when you select this circle, your Wild Shape is enhanced by your bond to the hungering spirits. The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into more dangerous animal forms. Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Wild Shape to transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as 1. You ignore the Max CR column of the Beast Shapes table, but must abide by the other limitations there. While Wild Shaped, you may use a bonus action to expend a spell slot and gain <a class="tooltip-hover rule-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">temporary hit points</a> equal to 1d6 per spell level.</p>
        <p>Starting at 6th level, you can transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as your druid level divided by 3, rounded down.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="PredatorsAmbush"><a href="#PredatorsAmbush"></a>Predator’s Ambush</h4>
        <p>Starting at level 6, you are always alert and ready to tap into the primal beast within the darkness. When you roll initiative, you may choose to immediately use Wild Shape as a free action. If you are attuned to a magical weapon, you may apply the magical benefits of the weapon to your natural weapon attacks.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="DarkStalker"><a href="#DarkStalker"></a>Dark Stalker</h4>
        <p>Starting at level 10, you embody the night and your presence spreads out to your allies, bonding them to you like a pack of predatory beasts. You and all allies within 20 feet of you cannot be <a class="tooltip-hover rule-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">surprised</a> and may treat any roll of <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Stealth" data-tooltip-href="">Stealth</a> or <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Intimidation" data-tooltip-href="">Intimidation</a> as if they rolled an 8 on the die.</p>

        <p>Your fury and destructive power is able to destroy even the most steadfast of structures. Starting at level 15, while Wild Shape is active, you treat the Damage Threshold of all objects as 0. All of your natural weapon attacks ignore damage resistances and immunities. Lastly, if you reduce an enemy to 0 hit points with a natural weapon attack, all enemies within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw versus your spell save DC or be <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">frightened</a> until the end of your next turn.</p>
        
        
        <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="DruidCircleCircleoftheSeed"><a href="#DruidCircleCircleoftheSeed"></a>Druid Circle: Circle of the Seed</h3>
        <p>The Circle of the Seed is a new type of druid, a way of thinking not focused on either the bulb or the hungry one. While it recognizes that each has a part to play in the balance of the world, they believe that the true nature of Calorum is change, growth, and progress. This can take many forms. It can be how the fields of Ceresia grow back after a great fire. It can be how farmers plant, grow, harvest, and replant year after year. It can be seen in the migration of the great beasts. It can be seen in the cycle of seasons and tides. Change is constant, relying on both creation and destruction but is also apart from both those forces. Followers of the Circle of the Seed have started spreading out from Candia in order to study the effects of the Awakening and what this great change can mean for the future of Candia.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Seedcaster"><a href="#Seedcaster"></a>Seedcaster</h4>
        <p>Your connection to the forces of Calorum allows you to hold a portion of gathered power in the form of seeds.</p>
        <p>Starting at 2nd level, when you select this circle, you are able to store a portion of power in the form of spellseeds. These spellseeds require you to hold them in one hand. During your turn as a bonus action, you may eat your seeds. Eating your seeds allows you to impose disadvantage on saving throws made by a single enemy targeted by your spells. Alternatively, you may regain a single spell slot of the highest level you can cast. Once your seeds are eaten, you cannot use them again until you complete a short rest.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="ForceofNature"><a href="#ForceofNature"></a>Force of Nature</h4>
        <p>Your spells are infused with the power of growth and change.</p>
        <p>Starting at 6th level, you may add your Wisdom modifier to the damage of all cantrips and spells you cast.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Overgrowth"><a href="#Overgrowth"></a>Overgrowth</h4>
        <p>You may send magic back into the land around you, causing plants to grow and sprout with vines and plants.</p>
        <p>As an action, you may cause a medium sized tree to sprout within 30 feet of you. As a bonus action, you may cause all trees to activate. They may either attack a creature within 5 feet of them or rejuvenate an ally within 5 feet.</p>
        <p>This attack uses your spell attack modifier to hit and deals 2d8 + your Wisdom modifier bludgeoning damage. The rejuvenation grants 2d6 <a class="tooltip-hover rule-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">temporary hit points</a> to you or an ally within 5 feet of them. You may have up to 3 plants active at a time.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="WalkWiththeSpirits"><a href="#WalkWiththeSpirits"></a>Walk With the Spirits</h4>
        <p>The spirits and beasts of the world recognize the power of the spirits that flow through you.</p>
        <p>Starting at 14th level, when a creature with the Beast, Dragon, Fey, or Plant subtypes tries to attack you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Druid Spell DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.</p>
        <p>The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.</p>
        
        
        <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="FighterMartialArchetypeKnightofNorthGumbia"><a href="#FighterMartialArchetypeKnightofNorthGumbia"></a>Fighter Martial Archetype: Knight of North Gumbia</h3>
        <p>In the northern realms of Candia lies the region of Gumbia. These lush verdant fields have a long and proud history of service and protection. Whether guarding their lands from bandits, repelling invaders, or protecting the people they care about most, the Knights of North Gumbia can be counted on as a strong arm and a firm shield in times of need. The Knights do not believe that battle is won by destroying the enemy, but by holding onto what matters most.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="ReadyataMomentsNotice"><a href="#ReadyataMomentsNotice"></a>Ready at a Moment’s Notice</h4>
        <p>Starting at level 3, when you select this subclass, your senses and battlefield awareness have become sharpened to a pristine edge as you are always on the lookout for danger. You cannot be <a class="tooltip-hover rule-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">surprised</a> and you may add your Constitution modifier to your initiative rolls.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="GumbianShield"><a href="#GumbianShield"></a>Gumbian Shield</h4>
        <p>Starting at level 3, you are practiced in leaping to the aid of your allies and protecting them from harm. During your turn, you may spend a bonus action to designate one ally within sight as your Ward. If your ward is attacked, you may use your reaction to move your speed and take the damage from the attack. This may be activated after a hit is declared but before damage is rolled. This damage can’t be reduced in any way.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="HereandThereEverywhere"><a href="#HereandThereEverywhere"></a>Here and There, Everywhere</h4>
        <p>Starting at level 7, the innate power of your Gumbian brethren fills you with power. Your jump distance is tripled and you may ignore the movement speed penalty and disadvantage that is imposed by heavy armor.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="BackAwaySlowly"><a href="#BackAwaySlowly"></a>Back Away Slowly</h4>
        <p>Starting at level 10, you know that fights can be avoided with the right choice of words or muscle. You have advantage on <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Persuasion" data-tooltip-href="">Persuasion</a> and <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Intimidation" data-tooltip-href="">Intimidation</a> checks.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="KnightsGambit"><a href="#KnightsGambit"></a>Knight’s Gambit</h4>
        <p>Starting at level 15, when you rush to aid your allies, you strike back at those that would bring them harm. When you use your Gumbian Shield ability to take damage for an ally, the triggering enemy takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your Constitution modifier. If you are wearing magic armor, you may add the armor’s enhancement bonus to damage.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="NeverGiveUp"><a href="#NeverGiveUp"></a>Never Give Up</h4>
        <p>Starting at level 18, your bravery and dedication can inspire your allies to remain on their feet and keep on fighting. If you take damage from a critical hit and remain conscious afterwards, you and all allies within 30 feet gain <a class="tooltip-hover rule-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">temporary hit points</a> equal to 2d6 + half your fighter level (rounded down).</p>
        
        
        <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="MonkTraditionFruitBrute"><a href="#MonkTraditionFruitBrute"></a>Monk Tradition: Fruit Brute</h3>
        <p>There is a tradition among Fructeran martial artists known as bruising. In these contests, two competitors throw themselves at each other using open handed strikes, body blows, and force of momentum to try and overpower their enemy. This originated in the pleasure gardens of Comida as a means to entertain the noble elites, but it has continued to grow beyond its origins. It embodies balance. The subtle shift of the body. The careful application of force. The means to use an enemy’s momentum against them and position them. Fruit Brutes, or Bruisers, seek to perfect their focus and form through the careful application of overpowering might.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="BruisingBlows"><a href="#BruisingBlows"></a>Bruising Blows</h4>
        <p>The first thing that is learned in the art of bruising is to hold and to shove an enemy, using well placed palm strikes and grabs to keep them off balance. Starting at level 3, when you hit a target with an attack granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can push that target 5 feet away from you. You may use the higher of your Constitution or Strength when making <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics" data-tooltip-href="">Athletics</a> checks to grapple or shove enemies. If you start your turn with an enemy <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">grappled</a>, you may deal damage equal to your Martial Arts die to them.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="SteadyastheMountain"><a href="#SteadyastheMountain"></a>Steady as the Mountain</h4>
        <p>Your focus on inner balance and power makes you a difficult opponent to shove around. Starting at level 6, you have advantage on Strength saving throws and ability checks. When you miss an attack, your next attack roll before the end of your next turn adds an additional 1d4 to the attack roll.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="BalanceofPower"><a href="#BalanceofPower"></a>Balance of Power</h4>
        <p>Your study of balance and momentum helps you turn the flow of battle in your favor. Starting at level 11, If you use Patient Defense or Step of the Wind, you may drag a <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">grappled</a> creature with no penalty to your speed. Additionally, you may release a creature you have <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">grappled</a> as a bonus action to push them up to half your speed in any direction. The released creature must make a Strength saving throw versus your ki save DC or be knocked <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">prone</a> and take damage equal to your Martial Arts dice. If this movement would cause them to come into contact with another creature, the impacted creature must make the same saving throw.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="ChosenFoe"><a href="#ChosenFoe"></a>Chosen Foe</h4>
        <p>At the highest level of your power, you are able to focus all your force into a singular target, honing in on their weak points for maximum effect. Starting at level 17, you may spend 4 ki points (no action required) to designate a single creature within your reach as your Chosen Foe. Attacks against your Chosen Foe score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. When you hit with an unarmed strike or weapon attack against your Chosen Foe, you may reroll any 1s or 2s on damage dice. If you score a critical hit against your Chosen Foe, the enemy must make a saving throw versus your ki save DC or be <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">stunned</a> until the start of your next turn.</p>
        <p>Your attacks against other creatures have disadvantage until your Chosen Foe is reduced to 0 hit points or you designate a new enemy as your Chosen Foe.</p>
        
        
        <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="PaladinOathofthePeractus"><a href="#PaladinOathofthePeractus"></a>Paladin: Oath of the Peractus</h3>
        <p>On the wheatfields of battle, it’s not always the strongest hand that wins. Sometimes, it’s the sharpest mind. The commanders of Ceresia know this better than anyone. Their legates and princeps have faced battle time and time again, and learned how to impart a lifetime of knowledge and experience to their men in battle. The most respected of these battlefield instructors are the Peractus. The Peractus is the title given to an aged and wizened soldier, sometimes a retired one, who sleeps, trains, and camps with the unit in order to lead by example and demonstrate the benefits of the Ceresian military mind.</p>
        
        
        <aside class="block-torn-paper">
        <p><strong>Tenets of the Peractus</strong></p>
        <p><strong><em>Prepare.</em></strong> Act not in haste, but with a plan.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Guidance.</em></strong> Lead from the front, not from the rear, no matter the danger.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Humility.</em></strong> A Peractus who shouts his rank is no true general. Speak quietly and trust the wisdom of your words to carry strength.</p>

        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="AuraofCalm"><a href="#AuraofCalm"></a>Aura of Calm</h4>
        <p>You are able to keep your allies alert and focused, prepared for action at a moment’s notice. The watchful eye of a Ceresian soldier knows where to expect danger and can teach their companions the warning signs.</p>
        <p>Starting at 7th level, you have advantage on initiative rolls and cannot be <a class="tooltip-hover rule-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">surprised</a>. Additionally, you and all allies within 10 feet have advantage on saving throws against traps and hazards. At 18th level the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="StandTogether"><a href="#StandTogether"></a>Stand Together</h4>
        <p>When you stand by your men, they stand with you. The might of a ceresian legion can hold any position and fear no danger.</p>
        <p>Starting at level 15, if you are within five feet of an ally, you and that ally may use your reaction to grant the other resistance to damage against one attack or spell.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="StandofthePeractus"><a href="#StandofthePeractus"></a>Stand of the Peractus</h4>
        <p>When times are dark and chaos is all around, a clear mind can turn the tide of battle and see the battle to its glorious end. As a bonus action, you may enter the Peractus’ Stand. This has several benefits:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>If you are within 5 feet of an enemy, all allies within 30 feet have advantage on the first attack roll they make against that enemy each round.</li>
        <li>If an ally within 30 feet of you takes damage, you may choose to take half of that damage.</li>
        <li>You and all allies within 30 feet gain the benefit of your Channel Divinity: Centrum.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once this ability has been used, it cannot be used again until you complete a long rest.</p>
        
        
        <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="RangerConclaveSpriteHunter"><a href="#RangerConclaveSpriteHunter"></a>Ranger Conclave: Sprite Hunter</h3>
        <p>In the dairy seas, there are fairies, ephemeral and unpredictable creatures of unknowable motives. Some trail behind ships, others lurk near hard parmesan shores to call ships to their doom, and others like to slip amongst the sailors and observe them. The Sprite Hunters have studied them, watched their ways, and learned to stalk and hunt just like them.</p>
        <p>Long before the Ravening War, the Sprite Hunters were an elite military unit, striking out at those that would threaten the dairy seas. But as time passed on, fewer and fewer sailors studied the fey, and fewer and fewer fey were able to be found. Now that the Awakening has brought magic back to the Dairy Seas, the sprites have started to return. And with them, the lost art of the Sprite Hunter. They are few in number, but very dangerous.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="MilkMaidsGift"><a href="#MilkMaidsGift"></a>Milk Maid’s Gift</h4>
        <p>Starting at 3rd level when you join this conclave, you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed and gain the ability to breathe underwater (or a water-like substance such as milk, cola, sangria, or butter).</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="FeyTools"><a href="#FeyTools"></a>Fey Tools</h4>
        <p>One of the secrets that was taught by The Sprites was to conjure tools from their own essence and magic. Starting at level 3, you may conjure a tool in your free hand. This tool can appear as a tentacle, a giant anchor, preternatural jaws, a harpoon, a fishing line or something else meaningful to the Sprite Hunter.</p>
        <p>As a bonus action, you can use this tool to strike at one creature of your choice that you can see within 15 feet. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw equal to your spell save DC or be pulled up to 10 feet in a horizontal direction of your choice. You may choose to grapple them instead of pulling them on a failed saving throw. If you do so, they may break out as normal during their turn. They take 1d6 damage at the start of your turn if you choose to maintain the grapple. It costs no action to maintain but the grapple is broken if you and your target are more than 15 feet apart. You may have only one tool in effect at a time unless a feature states otherwise.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="SlipintotheWaves"><a href="#SlipintotheWaves"></a>Slip into the Waves</h4>
        <p>Another secret taught by the fey was how to slip beneath the waves even if there was no ocean or lake to be found.</p>
        <p>Beginning at 7th level, you may dive into a body of liquid, even a dumped out cup will suffice, and then emerge somewhere else as an action. You magically teleport along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Before or after teleporting, you can make one attack, as part of your action. If you have someone hooked with your Fey Tools, you may bring them with you as well.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="EverythingBeneaththeWaves"><a href="#EverythingBeneaththeWaves"></a>Everything Beneath the Waves</h4>
        <p>At 11th level, you can manifest a benefit that corresponds to one of the creatures of the dairy isles. Select one of the benefits below when you complete a long rest, which lasts until the end of your next long rest.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Eyes of the Milkbottle Porpoise.</em></strong> You gain the ability to use echolocation. When you do so, you cast the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">arcane eye</a> spell, without using a spell slot or material components. After you cast a spell in this way, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Arms of the Creamtopus.</em></strong> While using Fey Tools, you now manifest two magical tools, which may be tentacles, chains and anchors, animated rigging, or another grasping arm of your choice. When you use your ability to pull them, you can attempt a grapple with each of your appendages. Additionally, creatures take 1d10 bludgeoning damage each time you maintain the grapple.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Heart of the Mozzawhales.</em></strong> On your turn, you can use a bonus action to gain <a class="tooltip-hover rule-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">temporary hit points</a> equal to 1d12 + your ranger level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short rest before you can use it again.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Soul of the Cheddaracuda.</em></strong> You are now immune to all effects that would cause you to be <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">charmed</a> or <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">frightened</a>.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Skin of the Brienacle.</em></strong> Your skin hardens, increasing your Armor Class by 1.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="DairyRider"><a href="#DairyRider"></a>Dairy Rider</h4>
        <p>At 15th level, when you use your Slip Into the Waves ability, the range is increased to 60 feet, and you can choose to appear with a wave of tidal force. When you appear, all creatures within 10 feet of you must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">grappled</a> by you has disadvantage on this saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 force damage and is knocked <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">prone</a>. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and is not knocked <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">prone</a>.</p>

        <p>On the border of The Meatlands and Ceresia lies the Sandwich Mountains, a region that has a long history of war, battle, and bloodshed. One of these ancient heroes was Bronn Donnal, the Baron of Burgenstock. He pledged himself to the Bulb to receive guidance in battle against his foes. Meatlander tribes, Ceresian legions trying to claim the territory, and Dairy Island pirates that raided his coastal holdings.</p>
        <p>To hold his lands, the Baron started a campaign of Spiking. He and his men would mount the corpses of his enemies on wooden spikes, displaying them on open plains as a warning to others. This technique of brutality and fear has been passed on in this region, adapted by many guerilla warriors and bandits. Spikers favor long piercing weapons, hindering foes in combat, and inspiring fear in enemies.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="CripplingStrikes"><a href="#CripplingStrikes"></a>Crippling Strikes</h4>
        <p>You don’t just hit your enemies where they hurt, you make sure they won’t escape either.</p>
        <p>Starting at level 3, when you deal Sneak Attack damage to an enemy, their speed is reduced by half until the end of your next turn.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="SpikersTools"><a href="#SpikersTools"></a>Spiker’s Tools</h4>
        <p>The favored weapon of Spikers are long handled piercing weapons.</p>
        <p>Starting at level 3, you are proficient in all spears and spear-like weapons. You may wield them one handed and they gain the <a class="tooltip-hover weapon-properties-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">finesse</a> property, even if they would normally be too big to be used one handed, unless they have the <a class="tooltip-hover weapon-properties-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">heavy</a> property.</p>
        <p>Additionally, if you ready an action to attack an enemy, you may add your Sneak Attack die to the damage, regardless of advantage or allies present.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="FriendofFear"><a href="#FriendofFear"></a>Friend of Fear</h4>
        <p>You know the touch of fear and terror and it does not hinder you. It empowers you.</p>
        <p>Starting at level 9, when you are immune to fear effects. If an enemy attempts to use a fear inducing spell or effect against you, you gain advantage on all attacks made before the end of your next turn.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="AceUptheSleeve"><a href="#AceUptheSleeve"></a>Ace Up the Sleeve</h4>
        <p>When you slay your enemies, you don’t just kill them, you create a mockery of their death to strike fear into your foes.</p>
        <p>Starting at level 13, when you reduce an enemy to 0 hit points, you may choose to create a Charcuterror. The Charcuterror is a medium-sized humanoid effigy made out of the dead or dying body of your enemy. All enemies within 30 feet of a Charcuterror subtract 1d4 from their attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. Additionally, you add your Charisma modifier to damage rolls while you are within 30 feet of a Charcuterror. You may create a number of Charcuterrors equal to your proficiency bonus.</p>
        <p>You regain all uses of this when you complete a short rest.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="FelltheWeak"><a href="#FelltheWeak"></a>Fell the Weak</h4>
        <p>The Spikers are known for their cruelty and ruthlessness in battle. There is a very good reason for that.</p>
        <p>Starting at 17th level, you may apply your Sneak Attack to any creature with less than half of their maximum hit points remaining. This does not allow you to apply Sneak Attacks more than once per turn.</p>
        <p>Additionally, your Sneak Attack dice are increased by one die size.</p>
        
        
        <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="RoguishArchetypeFirebrand"><a href="#RoguishArchetypeFirebrand"></a>Roguish Archetype: Firebrand</h3>
        <p>The world is… flawed. Corrupt. Imperfect. You know that it must be made right. When the world is made right, the Hungry One can feed and then the world can be reborn, remade, reprepared for a fresh start. Everything within it has a way to be prepared, improved, made more perfect. And you know how to wield blade and flame to make that possible. A firebrand is a devout believer of the Ramsayan Doctrine that abhors the existence of “Junk” food and seeks to purge the world of such filth and see it made more beautiful.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="SearingBlade"><a href="#SearingBlade"></a>Searing Blade</h4>
        <p>You are capable of striking with burning flame, preparing to send your enemies to the Hungry One.</p>
        <p>Starting at 3rd level when you select this archetype, you may spend a bonus action to wreathe your weapons in fire. Your weapon attacks deal fire damage for the next minute instead of their regular damage type.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="BurningInvective"><a href="#BurningInvective"></a>Burning Invective</h4>
        <p>You know how to single out a single target to be a receptacle for your rage and righteous fury.</p>
        <p>Starting at 3rd level, you may use your action to single out an individual within 40 feet and force them to make a Wisdom saving throw. The DC is equal to 10 + your proficiency bonus. If they fail, then you may add a d4 to all attack rolls against that target and re-roll all 1s that you roll for damage. Once this ability is used, it may not be used again until you score a critical hit on an enemy or complete a long rest.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="StandtheHeat"><a href="#StandtheHeat"></a>Stand the Heat</h4>
        <p>Your experiences with fire and flame and seasoning have hardened you against its use.</p>
        <p>Starting at 9th level, you have resistance to fire damage and you may see through smoke and flame without penalty.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="SparkofInspiration"><a href="#SparkofInspiration"></a>Spark of Inspiration</h4>
        <p>Your burning rhetoric may be destructive to your foes, but to your allies, it inspires determination and hope.</p>
        <p>Starting at level 13, whenever an enemy fails their saving throw against your Burning Invective, all allies within 30 feet of the target deal an additional 2d6 fire damage on all successful attacks made before the end of their next turn.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="UnstoppableFire"><a href="#UnstoppableFire"></a>Unstoppable Fire</h4>
        <p>Your purity of purpose and zealotry causes your blades to burn hotter than flame, with a white hot intensity that seems as if it comes from the bulb itself.</p>
        <p>Starting at 17th level, when you deal fire damage on your turn, you ignore any fire resistance they may possess. If they are normally immune to fire damage, they take half damage instead.</p>
        
        
        <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="SorcerousOriginSlimeBlooded"><a href="#SorcerousOriginSlimeBlooded"></a>Sorcerous Origin: Slime Blooded</h3>
        <p>There are many forms of slime and ooze that exist in the world of Calorum. The pink slime of the Meatlands, the Curdlings of the Dairy Sea, the Syrup Slimes of Candia, Fructeran Marmalades, Vegetanian Green Slime, and Ceresian Mother Doughs. Each of these are unpredictable and difficult to study. But sometimes, these slimes find shelter in a civilized area. In ship holds, wells, and basements.</p>
        <p>If someone pregnant happens to ingest a portion of the slime, there is a chance that their baby will be changed. Their body is malleable and soft but coursing with arcane power. This power is tied to the Hungry One and the hungry nature of the slimes of Calorum. If these children embrace their gifts, they learn to alter their bodies, turn to liquid, and gain more of the slime’s dangerous powers. What they do with this power is as unpredictable as their own nature.</p>

        <p>Starting at 1st level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Slime Blooded Spells table.

        <p>Starting at level 1 when you select this origin, you learn to control your strange and mutable anatomy as well as your spells. When you cast a spell that deals damage, you may choose to change the damage type to acid.</p>
        <p>Additionally, when you finish a long rest, select one of the following benefits. You gain the chosen benefit until you complete a long rest. You may switch benefits by spending 1 sorcery point. This may be done on your turn using no action.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Compact.</em></strong> You become smaller and more compact and bouncy. You gain resistance to falling damage and become Small-sized. You have disadvantage on athletics checks while this is active.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Stretchy.</em></strong> Your body is wider, flatter, and graceful. You gain advantage on <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics" data-tooltip-href="">Athletics</a> checks to jump and your jump distance is tripled. You have disadvantage on stealth while this is active.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Caustic.</em></strong> Your body becomes dripping and acidic. Enemies that strike you with a natural weapon take damage equal to 1d4 + your Charisma modifier. You have disadvantage on Charisma based skill checks while this is active.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Copying.</em></strong> You shift your features to look like someone else. You gain the benefits of the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">disguise self</a> spell. However, this form is hard to maintain. This <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">disguise self</a> is a concentration effect.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Malleable.</em></strong> Your body is loose and easily molded. You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. You also gain vulnerability to one of the two damage types you did not select.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="OozingForm"><a href="#OozingForm"></a>Oozing Form</h4>
        <p>Starting at level 6, you are able to siphon off a portion of power from your spells to propel your body across the ground, like oil over water. When you use your action to cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you may use your bonus action to <a class="tooltip-hover action-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">Dash</a>.

        <p>Starting at level 14, your body becomes even more malleable and caustic, even able to appear as a liquid. You become immune to acid damage. You may fit through openings 1 inch wide, treating anything less than 6 inches as <a class="tooltip-hover rule-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">difficult terrain</a>. Any items that you choose to bring with you when doing this, are able to become liquid slime and are not harmed by this effect.</p>
        <p>As an action, you may turn into a puddle of slime to corrode metal, allowing you to destroy a 6 foot wide portion of metal or stone that is one inch thick each round if you choose.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Consumption"><a href="#Consumption"></a>Consumption</h4>
        <p>Starting at level 18, you are able to consume and devour enemies that are slain by your spells. If you use a spell to reduce an enemy to 0 hit points you may destroy their bodies and consume them. Using this ability costs 1 sorcery point. Any enemies reduced to 0 hit points by this spell are reduced to flowing slime and absorbed into your body so that not even the Hungry One can taste their souls. You regain hit points equal to twice the level of the spell used. Their body and any worn or held items are destroyed. Magic items are unaffected.</p>

        <p>A warlock that follows The Putris draws power from the undying force of rot and mold that lurks beneath the surface of Calorum. The fabled Mushroom Queendom has ties to the heretical order of the Bulbian Church, the Sanctus Putris. The Putris works to preserve Calorum, spreading rot and contagion in order to ward off the Hungry One. This power is not tied to either The Bulb or The Hungry One, but that power of change that exists between the two. The Putris is said to be growing stronger, gradually influencing the events of the surface to spread the influence of rot far and wide.</p>

        <p>Starting at 1st level when you select this patron, you may add an additional spell to your spells known. This must be taken from the cleric spell list. When you gain a new level of spells, you may select an additional spell known from the cleric spell list.</p>

        <p>Starting at 1st level, when you reduce an enemy to 0 hit points, enemies within 10 feet of the slain enemy take necrotic damage equal to 1d6 + your Charisma modifier.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="RottingHusk"><a href="#RottingHusk"></a>Rotting Husk</h4>
        <p>As you move through the battlefield, you can animate the corpse of a fallen enemy with spores and rot, commanding it to fight for you.</p>
        <p>Starting at 6th level, you can use an action to command a corpse to rise under your command. It has the statistics of a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">zombie</a>. You may use your bonus action to command them to move and attack during your turn. If you do not command them, they will follow the last command given. It uses your spell attack bonus to hit with its Slam attack and adds your Charisma modifier to damage. You may have up to two of these active at one time. When you complete a short or long rest, you may create one Rotting Husk to follow your commands.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="ToxinResistant"><a href="#ToxinResistant"></a>Toxin Resistant</h4>

        <p>Starting at 14th level, you can use an action to summon eight sections of mycelium. Each section is 5 feet wide, 5 feet tall, and 1 foot thick. Any enemy that starts their turn within 5 feet of a section of wall must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. If they fail, they suffer the poisoned condition and take 4d6 poison damage. Enemies that failed must save again at the end of their turn or suffer the same effect again at the start of their next turn.</p>

        <p>The Snackromancers are a secretive order of mages that research the nature of the Hungry One and the power gained by consuming living things. Snackromancers keep a supply of cooking utensils, seasonings, and preparation methods on hand in order to experiment on new… samples. The main secret they have unlocked is the ability to shape spells into small bite sized snacks, allowing spells to be handed to allies for a moment of need. While their research and methods are seen as strange and macabre to most, they are not sadists. They are looking into the darkness and searching for truth.</p>

        <p>Starting at 2nd level, you have learned to shape your spells into small bite sized snacks. Often these take the form of candies, cookies, chips, or anything else that is small and bite-sized. Each snack draws on your own magic and a piece of a living creature, even something as small as a hair or nail is enough to make this work.</p>
        <p>When you complete a long rest, you may expend your spell slots to create Spellsnacks that hold the spell for later. You may expend a spell slot of any level you have access to and create a consumable item called a Spellsnack. This Spellsnack holds a spell of a level equal to or less than the spell slot you expended to create it. You may hold onto these snacks or hand them to allies.</p>
        <p>Consuming a snack requires an action, just like drinking a potion, and allows the eater to gain the benefits of the spell stored within. When they use the Spellsnack, they gain the benefit of the spell as if it had been cast by you at the appropriate level. You may store any spell with a range of self that you have learned and are capable of casting. You may prepare a maximum number of Spellsnacks each day equal to your proficiency bonus.</p>

This is a melee weapon attack that you are proficient with and uses your strength modifier for attack and damage. It deals piercing damage equal to 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier on a successful attack. If the creature has any damage resistances, you gain one of them until you complete a short or long rest. You may only have one stolen resistance at a time. When you successfully hit an enemy with your bite attack, you may immediately expend your bonus action and a spell slot to deal bonus force damage equal to 2d6 per level of the spell slot expended.</p>

After consuming one of your Spellsnacks, the individual has advantage on one Attack Roll, Ability check, or Saving Throw they make before the end of their next turn. You may also create up to two additional Spell Snacks after you complete a short rest. Any Spell Snacks that were not consumed may be altered to contain a different spell of the same level or lower. The maximum number of active Spellsnacks is still limited by your Proficiency Bonus.</p>

        <p><em>Blancmange</em> uses the statistics of a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">+1 heavy crossbow</a>. It generates a shot when it is fired so it does not have the <a class="tooltip-hover weapon-properties-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">loading</a> property.

        <p>This ancient weapon was carried by St. Crispen who was given this spear by Mother Mara Malken of the Bulbian church. With it, she bade him carry the message of the Bulb to the Meatlands. And so he did, establishing the first churches and centers of worship of The Bulb, eventually coming to rest in the town of Burgenstock for the last years of his life. Through his travels, the spear became blessed by the light and a symbol of the bulb, serving as blade, crook, staff, and scepter as needed. This weapon was lain to rest after being used by Vinchenzo Von’Beefbolt in his battle against the tyrannical Baron of Burgenstock.</p>
        <Attacks>This <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">+3 spear</a> deals double damage to Undead creatures. Attacks against Evil or Undead creatures have an additional +2 to attack and damage.</p>
        <p>As an action, the wielder is able to restore all allies within 30 feet of the wielder up to half their maximum hit points (rounded down), keeping them on their feet. Once this property is used, it may not be used again until the wielder completes a long rest.</p>
        <p>Lastly, it has one more minor power. As a bonus action, the wielder may transform this spear into any one or two handed melee weapon or tool that they are proficient in and provides a 1d4 bonus to skill checks when it is not in the form of a weapon.</p>

        <p>This <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">+1 dagger</a> takes the shape of a collection of small shurikens with edges that gimmer with blue arcane magic. After hitting a target, the magic fades from the thrown missile and a new one appears in the wielder’s hand at the start of their next turn. This ensures they do not run out of ammunition. The <em>Blue Points</em> have an additional power that may be used when they successfully deal damage to a creature.</p>
        <p>After the <em>Blue Points</em> deal damage to a creature, you may choose to cast the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">sleep</a> spell centered on the target of your last attack. This spell is cast at second level (7d8). Any damage dealt with your attack is added to the dice rolled by the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">sleep</a> spell to determine if the target of the attack falls asleep.

        <p>Additionally, if you strike an enemy with both of these weapons during your turn, the enemy must choose to either take 2d6 fire damage or drop a single item they are holding in their hand. A DC 13 Dexterity saving throw reduces the damage by half or allows them to keep possession of the item they are holding. They must choose before rolling a saving throw.</p>

        <p>These ancient blade were given to the first of the Tartguard. In those days, before the ravening war and even the nation of Candia, the Tartguard were peacekeepers and advisors. They were pacifists and warriors, never slaying a foe but standing firm against those that would cause harm. Twelve of these weapons were forged of woven taffy, braided into a flexible rainbow blade. The blade was a symbol of station, but in times of dire need could be used to defend. However, the Tartguard most often use them in small bits of jest to amuse people and calm their spirits.</p>
        <p>An <em>Epiee</em> is a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">+1 rapier</a>. On a hit, the wielder deals psychic damage in place of the weapon’s normal damage dice. Any creature reduced to 0 hit points by this weapon immediately stabilizes.</p>
        <p>If you score a critical hit using this weapon, the target of the attack must make a Wisdom saving throw or laugh uncontrollably. They are <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">stunned</a> until the end of their next turn or until they take damage, whichever comes first.</p>
        <p>If the wielder sees a creature being attacked within 60 feet of themselves, they may use their reaction to cast <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">sanctuary</a> on the victim at up to 300 feet range. Once this is used, they may not be used again until the wielder completes a short rest.

        <p>As a bonus action during your turn, you may wreath this weapon in fire. All attacks made with this weapon until the end of your turn deal an additional 1d8 fire damage.</p>
        <p>If you roll a 19 or 20 on an attack against a target, they immediately catch fire. This fire deals 1d6 fire damage at the start of their turn and increases by 1d6 each turn they do not put it out (max 5d6 total). They may put out the fire as an action.</p>
        <p>Lastly, you are immune to fire damage from natural sources such as campfires, <a class="tooltip-hover item-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">torches</a>, and burning oil. This immunity does not apply to magical effects such as spells and monster abilities.</p>

Streaks of energy course from the end of the barrel and down to the loading chamber. Each shot launches a spray of bubbling acid and a powerful concussive blast that sounds like an immense fart of overwhelming volume.</p>
        <p>When fired, this cannon emits either a 25 foot cone or a 40 foot line of bubbling acid. Creatures in the line of fire take 10d6 acid damage. A DC 13 Dexterity saving throw reduces this by half. Additionally, all creatures in the affected area that failed their saving throws lose any resistances to acid, cold, fire, or lightning damage they previously possessed until they take an action to scrape the bubbling syrup off of them.</p>
        <p>This cannon requires powerful alchemical reagents to fire. These are often harvested from strange beasts and recently uncovered sources of flavor crystals. A single shot costs 50 gp in most markets, but a skilled alchemist can make one with a half hour of work and 20 gp of raw materials.</p>
        <p>This cannon is wheeled and can be moved in a straight line each round at a speed equal to the land speed of the creature pushing or pulling it. Changing directions mid turn reduces the pushers’ speed by half. The cannon occupies its own 5 foot space and weighs five hundred pounds. Each piece of ammunition weighs five pounds. If the ammunition takes fire damage, the DM rolls a d6. On a 1, the ammunition explodes in a 30-foot radius, dealing its damage to all creatures in the area.</p>

This hammer has a powerful enchantment in it, a fraction of the Hungry One’s power that was awakened by the death of so many on the field of battle.</p>
        <p><em>The Tenderizer</em> is a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">+1 maul</a>. Drawing or sheathing <em>The Tenderizer</em> costs either an action or bonus action during your turn. It has two special powers.</p>
        <p>As an action you may make a melee or ranged attack (15/45) using your melee attack bonus. If you hit, all creatures, except you, within 15 feet of your primary target take damage as if hit by <em>The Tenderizer</em>. Your target must make a DC 14 strength saving throw or be knocked <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">prone</a> and take an additional 3d10 damage. All squares in the area affected by this ability become <a class="tooltip-hover rule-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">difficult terrain</a> as the <em>The Tenderizer</em> leaves cracked and broken ground. If you miss with this power, it is not expended. Once you hit with this ability you may regain it by spending 2 Hit Dice as a bonus action, regaining no hit points in the process, or by completing a long rest.</p>
        <p>You deal double damage to objects.</p>
        <p>However, there is one drawback to this weapon. Due to its massive heft, you must have a Strength of 16 or higher to use this effectively. If you do not meet this requirement, all attacks with this weapon are made with disadvantage.</p>

        <p>The Fields of Cerisia are home to the graves of many unnamed soldiers. Before the Wonderbread was killed by bulbian crusaders and the Legion of the Whole Grain it sent its blessing to the semolian remains of those who fell on the Amber Fields forming into a whip of golden wheat. Fifteen feet of braided yellow death <em>al dente</em>, with a sharp cutting edge on the last yard of the length. This immense weapon is a blend of a scythe and a whip, requiring two hands or the clear determination of a practiced wielder to use properly.</p>
        <p><em>Threshing Field</em> is a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">+2 weapon</a> that does 2d6 slashing damage with the <a class="tooltip-hover weapon-properties-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">two-handed</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover weapon-properties-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">reach</a>, and <a class="tooltip-hover weapon-properties-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">finesse</a> properties.</p>
        <p>It grants the wielder 3 Superiority Dice at 1d6 each, like the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/fighter#CombatSuperiority">Battlemaster ability</a>, that may be used to activate the Parry, Riposte, and Disarm abilities from the same Fighter Archetype.</p>
        <p>When they complete a long rest they may spend 2 of their superiority dice at the start of the day. If they do so, <em>Threshing Field</em> loses the <a class="tooltip-hover weapon-properties-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">two-handed</a> property until the next time the wielder completes a long rest and makes this choice again.</p>
        <p>Lastly, the wielder may release a cluster of blazing barley at a spot within 60 feet of the wielder. This detonates with the effect of a 3rd level <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">fireball</a> spell (8d6 fire damage, 20 foot radius, save DC 14). Once used, it may not be used again until the wielder completes a long rest.</p>

        <p>The White Fang Order believes that the Hungry One can be kept sated and the world safe if their appetite can be appeased. To that end, they preserve its power and strength by crafting objects of sweetness but without sugar, preserving the health and spirit of the hungry one without feeding him and souls and sugars of Candian magic. <em>Triple Dent</em> is one of those creations.</p>
        <p><em>Triple Dent</em> is a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">+1 spear</a> or <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">trident</a>. Changing from one form to another is a free action that can be taken at the start of the wielder’s turn. When the owner scores a critical hit, with this weapon they can choose to release it from their hand. If they do so, the weapon continues to deal 1d8 + 1 piercing damage at the start of the owner’s turn. The owner may end this as a bonus action, which also returns the weapon to their hand. The power of the <em>Triple Dent</em> is long lasting and intense. If a creature is slain while under <em>Triple Dent’s</em> critical effect, the weapon automatically returns to the owner’s hand and they gain 1d8 + 1 <a class="tooltip-hover rule-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">temporary hit points</a>.</p>

        <p>This sturdy pondo is made of pressed lengths of caul fat and froggrass woven into a tight mesh with various herbs, berries, and spices native to the meatlands growing over its surface.</p>
        <p>This cloak provides a +1 bonus to all saving throws and to Armor Class.</p>
        <p>Because of this ready source of supplies, you have advantage on ability checks relating to plants and identifying natural phenomenon.</p>
        <p>In addition to this, the berries growing along the surface of the cloak may be consumed for a beneficial effect. Each time you use a berry, roll a d4. If you roll a 1, you are unable to make more berries until you complete a long rest.</p>
        <p>Eating a berry restores hit points as if the user expended a hit die during a short rest. The wearer may pick and consume a berry as a single bonus action or pass it off to an ally within 5 feet as part of the bonus action used to pick it. If a target is unconscious, it is an action to feed it to them.</p>
        <p>Lastly, if you are reduced to 0 hit points, the earth of the Meatlands moves to protect you. Vines and dirt covers your body, blocking you from harm. These vines have an AC of 10 and 20 hit points. You may not take damage from outside sources until these vines are destroyed. You also have advantage on checks to stabilize a dying creature.</p>

        <p>These fine cocoa-leather gloves are lined with fine peanut dusted fabric for comfort and ease of movement.</p>
        <p>They grant you advantage on checks made to escape grapples or any effect that would restrict your movement.</p>
        <p>Additionally, any cantrip that you know may be used at a range of touch if you choose.</p>
        <p>Lastly, when you cast a spell that covers an area, you may alter the size and shape of it so that it doesn’t lay a finger on your allies. You may move up to 25 square feet from the affected area to another spot at the edge of the effect. This is a single 5×5 square, such as that occupied by a single Medium creature. You may do this up to 3 times for each spell that you cast.</p>

        <p>These boots are made of densely packed, marinated, and dried spam. They carry the spirit of a spamelope inside them, granting their springiness and energy to the wearer.

        <p>This short length cloak is made from the cast off, chalk hued, bark of the snickerbark tree. These strips of dusty bark are held together with lengths of strawberreeds.</p>
        <p>When shaken, as an action, it releases a cloud of spores and dust. This effect is identical to the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">fog cloud</a> spell cast at 1st level and does not require concentration. Any enemy that starts its turn in the cloud takes poison damage equal to 1d4 + your proficiency bonus. This ability may be used up to 3 times. You regain all uses when you complete a long rest.</p>

        <p>This small purse can fit a lot more than its appearance would suggest. It looks like a well made one handed basket with a plaid covering.</p>
        <p>This clutch can hold up to 125 cubic feet of materials (a 5-foot cube) as long whatever is placed into it is no more than 5 feet in any dimension.</p>
        <p>It also functions as a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">+1 weapon</a> that can be wielded one handed or two handed. If used one handed, it deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage. Held two handed, it deals 1d12 bludgeoning damage. This weapon rerolls 1s on damage dice when used in conjunction with Reckless Attack.</p>
        <p>This hand bag also grants the holder the ability to use <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">prestidigitation</a> and <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">minor image</a> to change their clothing into whatever they so desire, no concentration required.

        <p>This <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">+1 breastplate</a> is forged from heat treated henplate, which gives it a rough, craggly, appearance. While worn, the wearer takes 2 less damage from attacks that deal bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage. The wearer may also cast the spell <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">grease</a> as a bonus action. Once this spell is used, it may not be used again until you finish a long rest. They are immune to the effects of their own <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">grease</a>.</p>

        <p><em>Requires attument by a bard</em></p>
        <p>This beaded wand of golden buttered corn shines when you wield it and use it to perform. The sound of it is a jingling sound, like a cistrum.</p>
        <p>When an ally rolls a Bardic Inspiration die that you granted them and the result is even, the power of inspiration “pops” from them to another ally you could target. That ally gains a lesser inspiration die that adds 1d4 to any roll that could be affected by Bardic Inspiration.</p>

        <p>This pair of gloves are made of soft brioche crust leather, lightly browned. They contain multiple tiny pockets to help conceal items and may also offer protection from elemental attacks.</p>
        <p>These gloves each contain an extradimensional space capable of storing a single weapon, shield, or any object smaller than 16 inches in any dimension. Hiding or storing an item in the gloves is part of a bonus action.</p>
        <p>If you are hit by fire or cold damage, you may use your reaction to gain resistance to that type of damage for up to ten minutes. While you have this resistance, you may use an action to exhale a cone of elemental power. This cone deals 5d6 damage of the appropriate type. Enemies may roll a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw for half damage. Using this ability removes your elemental resistance.</p>

        <li>You have resistance to cold damage.</li>
        <li>If a creature scores a critical hit against you the spirits of the beasts that inhabit this armor act to punish them.

Each one is barely felt on its own, but as a group, they can crush and surround a target. They enjoy adhering themselves to a large target and then giving commands and directions.

They are trained first as craftsmen, able to use their hulking strength and unique bodies to create immense works of architecture. Lobbing sticky mortar, carving stones, polishing columns, and lifting things into place. And when they have been used on the battlefield, their power has been fearsome. A single Panzanari is capable of annihilating an entire platoon with ease.

        <p>A honey keeper is a type of fey that is found in Candia. They are similar to the nonpareil, but are far more dangerous and malicious. They have begun to be spotted in the places of Candia that were devastated during the War of the Concord, especially near Port Syrup. They take the form of a weeping adult wearing heavy cloaks or robes to hide their faces. They are always seen carrying a child or pet in their arms. But on closer inspection, they are a skeleton made entirely out of compressed sugar and syrup, covered with buzzing bees with honeycomb wax filling in their cavities. The figure in their arms is likewise grown over with honeycombs inside and out. Most think these are undead, but they are actually a type of a type of fey creature, that mimics Candians to lure victims closer in order to suck the sugar from their bodies.</p>

        <p>They may cast any combination of the following spells as touch spells up to five times per day: <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">bestow curse</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">blight</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">blindness/deafness</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">chill touch</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="" data-tooltip-href="">confusion</a></p>

        <p> </p>
        <p><strong><em>Mimicry.</em></strong> The honey keeper may mimic the animal sounds and humanoid voices.

        <p> </p>
        <p><strong><em>Invisible Passage.</em></strong> The honey keeper draws on their inner connection to Calorum and uses it to blend into the environment.

The bees are mentally controlled by the honey keeper and no action is required to command them. The swarm or swarms act immediately after the honey keeper. The bee swarms can attack and move as normal. In addition to the normal effects of their attacks, all enemies within 5 feet of the swarm take 2 (1d4) psychic damage. The honey keeper can have two swarms active at any given time. If a third swarm is summoned, then whichever swarm has the fewest hit points is dismissed.</p>

The types of vegetables a saladmander can be made out of can vary wildly depending on the ponds of the forest they live in, resulting in incredible ecological diversity. They also have a habit of waiting underneath veggie wood used by people for fires, then scampering out ablaze when the flame is lit. It is for this reason they were seen as incarnations of flame and, unfortunately, servants of the Hungry One, leading to the Bulbian church organizing a minor crusade against the saladmander, leading to a lot of their numbers being lost over the past few centuries.</td>
